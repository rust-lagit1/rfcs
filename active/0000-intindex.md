# Replacement

## I propose to withdraw this RFC in favor of the single-purpose [RFC: Renaming int/uint (PR #464)](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/464).


# Summary

Either rename the types `int` and `uint` to `index` and `uindex` to avoid
misconceptions and misuses, or specify that they're always at least 32-bits wide
to avoid the worst portability problems. Also document when to use and not use
these types and which integer type to pick "by default." (See below for the
meaning of "by default.")


# Motivation

  - To avoid new integer overflow bugs when moving Rust code to smaller address spaces.
  - So programmers will know when to use which integer types.


# Background

The Rust language does array indexing using the smallest integer types that span
the address space. For this, Rust defines integer types `int` and `uint` to be
large enough to hold a pointer in the target environment. Beware that it does
not promise that these are the fastest, "native," register, or C sized integers
despite the names.

(A rationale given for using unsigned array indexes is to allow array bounds
checking in one comparison rather than two. However, a compiler can generate one
unsigned comparison to bounds-check a signed integer index as long as the lower
bound is 0.)

`int`/`uint` may also be good choices for indexing and sizing in-memory
containers. But using these types for computations that are not limited by
memory leads to code that's not portable to smaller-address targets than it was
developed and tested on.

From C/C++/Java experience, programmers have learned to pick `int`/`uint`
as the "default" integer types where not particularly constrained by
requirements, e.g.:

  * where any modest-size integer will do (e.g. a loop index)
  * to avoid cluttering APIs with ungermane integer sizes
  * to hold tags and other values supplied by callers

Programmers should figure out a value's needed range then maybe widen to
a "default" type for easy interconnections. For a value in the range 1 .. 100,
you can pick from 10 types. Choosing an 8-bit or 16-bit integer is an
optimization. Premature? Which integer type should you pick when you're writing
exploratory code and haven't yet done the range analysis? What if you're passing
values through many layers of code and computations?

A default is handy but a target-dependent size does not make a good default. And
yet `int` and `uint` _look_ like default integer types.

To clear up some misconceptions from C/C++:

  * _They're not the fastest integers._ Example: x86_64 and ARM64 have 64-bit address spaces and 64-bit integer registers, but 32-bit integers are faster since those arithmetic instructions are faster, more data fits in cache, and the vector instructions can operate on twice as many values at a time.
  * _They're not "native" size or register size._ Example: The [x32 ABI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X32_ABI) has 64-bit general purpose registers but 32-bit pointers so its `int`/`uint` are 32-bit.
  * _They're not necessarily the same size as C `int`._ C doesn't define `int` the same way.
  * _They're not wide enough to casually pick,_ given 16-bit address spaces.
  * _They're not "portable."_ They overflow differently and take different numbers of binary I/O bytes on different platforms.

These misconceptions lead to misuses and thus to code with overflow bugs
(checked or unchecked) when running in a smaller address space than originally
considered and tested.

The worst failure mode is in libraries written with desktop CPUs in mind and
then used in small embedded devices (such as Atmel AVR, PIC controllers, and TI
MSP430). Rust is a very compelling replacement for C/C++ in embedded devices
and safety-critical robotics actuators.


# Detailed design

Change these two type names so they're self-documenting and less misused. The
names `index` and `uindex` are meant to convey their use in array indexing. Use
them more narrowly.

Alternate name choices:

  - `isize` and `usize`, [borrowing from C's](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/types/integer) `ssize_t` and `size_t` but adopting Rust's integer prefixes.
  - `intptr` and `uintptr`, [borrowing from C's](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/types/integer) `intptr_t` and `uintptr_t`. These names are awkward by design.
  - `PointerSizedInt` and `PointerSizedUInt`.
  - `intps` and `uintps`.

To ease the transition, first deprecate the old types.

**Alternative:** Specify that these two integer types are _at least 32-bits
wide_ on every target architecture. That avoids the worst failure mode although
it doesn't help when code tested in a 64-bit address space later runs in a
32-bit address space.


## Integer type style guidelines

Recommend using the `index` and `uindex` (or `int` and `uint`) types only for
array indexing and similar purposes.

Elect a particular integer type for programmers to pick "by default". This RFC
recommends `i32`.

On using unsigned types for numbers that should never be negative:

  * If Rust provides integer overflow checking (see [RFC PR #146: Scoped attributes for checked arithmetic](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/146)) then recommend unsigned integer types.
  * If not, recommend signed integers with manual assertions except in special cases such as modulo 2^N arithmetic and when representing a bit pattern rather than a number.

The [Google C++ Style Guide](http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/cppguide.xml?showone=Integer_Types#Integer_Types) says:

> In particular, do not use unsigned types to say a number will never be negative. Instead, use assertions for this. ...
>
> Some people, including some textbook authors, recommend using unsigned types to represent numbers that are never negative. This is intended as a form of self-documentation. However, in C, the advantages of such documentation are outweighed by the real bugs it can introduce.

That's because C lacks overflow detection. To quote [GÃ¡bor Lehel](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/161/files#r14857522):

> This suggestion [signed integers with assertions] makes a lot of sense in a context where overflow/underflow silently wraps around. However, if something like [RFC PR #146](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/146) were to be implemented, then it would once again make sense to use types which more accurately express the range of legal values (i.e., which are self-documenting), because compiler-added checks can be enabled to catch errors where the value would go out of range. Accurate types with compiler-added assertions beats inaccurate types with programmer-added assertions.

FYI from the [Google C++ Style Guide](http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/cppguide.xml?showone=Integer_Types#Integer_Types):

> You should assume that an `int` is at least 32 bits, but don't assume that it has more than 32 bits.

This assumption does not hold for PalmOS even on 32-bit ARM, where `int` is
16-bits for backward compatibility with PalmOS running on Motorola 68000.


# Drawbacks

  - Renaming `int`/`uint` requires figuring out which of the current uses to replace with `index`/`uindex` vs. `i32`/`u32`/`BigInt`.
  - The new names are more verbose.


# Alternatives

  1. Set a coding style guide and code review expectation to use `int`/`uint` only for array indexing and related operations despite C programmers' expectations. Elect an integer type such as `i32` to use "by default." Update the existing libraries.
  2. Fix the portability bugs later.


# Notes

See the discussions from many contributors to [Issue #14758](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/14758) and [Issue #9940](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/9940).

[Daniel Micay notes](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/9940#issuecomment-32104831):

> If you're using `int` as a "default", then you're not using it correctly. It
> will be 16-bit on an architecture with a 16-bit address space, 32-bit or
> 64-bit. If you're doing your testing on a 64-bit architecture, you're going to
> miss plenty of bugs.

[Carter Tazio notes](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/9940#issuecomment-32088729)
that system-dependent integers in GHC Haskell cause recurring problems, and
there's some buy-in for fixing it.

[Niko Matsakis requested](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/9940#issuecomment-32119318)
a survey of uses of `int` and `uint` showing how many of them are
appropriate / inappropriate / borderline.

More recently, [type inference was changed to not fall back to `int`/`uint`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/6023) and there's an RFC for
[Scoped attributes for checked arithmetic](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/146).

[Issue #11831](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/11831) is also about
`int` and `uint` pointer-sized integers. Was the conclusion the type inference
change? A commitment to the names `int` and `uint`? In the latter case, this
RFC amounts to making `int`/`uint` at least 32-bits wide and setting style
guidelines for integer types.


# Not in scope of this RFC

  * Changes in overflow handling.
  * Giving `Vec` a settable index size as `Vec<T, Index=uint>`.
  * Adding more target-dependent integer types such as C's `int_fast32_t` -- the fastest signed integer type at least 32 bits wide. (Do this in a library?)
