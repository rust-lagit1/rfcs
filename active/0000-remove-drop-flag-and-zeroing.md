# Summary

Three step plan:

 1. Revise language semantics for drop so that all branches move or drop
    the same pieces of state ("drop obligations").  To satisfy this
    constraint, the compiler has freedom to move the drop code for
    some state to earlier points in the control flow ("early drops").

 2. Add lints to inform the programmer of situations when this new
    drop-semantics could cause side-effects of RAII-style code
    (e.g. releasing locks, flushing buffers) to occur sooner than
    expected.

    Types that have side-effectful drop implement a marker trait,
    `NoisyDrop`, that drives a warn-by-default lint; another marker
    trait, `QuietDrop`, allows types to opt opt.  An allow-by-default
    lint provides a way for programmers to request notification of all
    auto-inserted early-drops.

 3. Remove the dynamic tracking of whether a value has been dropped or
    not; in particular, (a) remove implicit addition of a drop-flag by
    `Drop` impl, and (b) remove implicit zeroing of the memory that
    occurs when values are dropped.

# Motivation

Currently, implementing `Drop` on a struct (or enum) injects a hidden
bit, known as the "drop-flag", into the struct (and likewise, each of
the the enum variants).  The drop-flag, in tandem with Rust's implicit
zeroing of dropped values, tracks whether a value has already been
moved to another owner or been dropped.  (See the ["How dynamic drop
semantics works"](#how-dynamic-drop-semantics-works) appendix for more details if you are unfamiliar
with this part of Rust's current implementation.)

## Problems with dynamic drop semantics

Here are some problems with this situation:

 * Most important: implicit memory zeroing is a hidden cost that today
   all Rust programs pay, in both execution time and code size.
   With the removal of the drop flag, we can remove implicit memory
   zeroing (or at least revisit its utility -- there may be other
   motivations for implicit memory zeroing, e.g. to try to keep secret
   data from being exposed to unsafe code).

 * Hidden bits are bad, part I: Users coming from a C/C++ background
   expect `struct Foo { x: u32, y: u32 }` to occupy 8 bytes, but if
   `Foo` implements `Drop`, the hidden drop flag will cause it to
   double in size (16 bytes).
   See the ["Program illustrating space impact of hidden drop flag"]
   (#program-illustrating-space-impact-of-hidden-drop-flag)
   appendix for a concrete illustration.

 * Hidden bits are bad, part II: Some users have expressed an
   expectation that the drop-flag only be present for individual local
   variables, but that is not what Rust does currently: when `Foo`
   implements `Drop`, each instance of `Foo` carries a drop-flag, even
   in contexts like a `Vec<Foo>` where a program
   cannot actually move individual values out of the collection.
   Thus, the amount of extra memory being used by drop-flags is not
   bounded by program stack growth; the memory wastage is strewn
   throughout the heap.

The above are the main motivations for removing the drop flag.

## Abandoning dynamic drop semantics

How do we actually remove the drop flag? The answer: By replacing
the dynamic drop semantics (that implicitly checks the flag to
determine if a value has already been dropped) with a *static drop
semantics* (that performs drop of certain values more eagerly,
i.e. before the end of their owner's lexical scope).

A static drop semantics essentially works by inserting implicit calls
to `mem::drop` at certain points in the control-flow to ensure that
the set of values to drop is statically known at compile-time.
(See ["How static drop semantics works"](#how-static-drop-semantics-works)
in the detailed design for more discussion of how this is done.)

There are two important things to note about a static drop semantics:

 1. It should be *equal* in expressive power to the Rust language as we know
    it today.

    If the user is actually relying on the drop-flag today in some
    variable or field declaration `x: T`, they can replace that
    declaration with `x: Option<T>` and thus recreate the effect of
    the drop-flag.

    (Note that formal comparisons of expressiveness typically say
    nothing about *convenience*; this RFC is explicitly sacrificing
    the "convenience" of the implicit drop flag, under the assumption
    that in the common case, programmers would choose an early-drop
    over an `Option<T>` wrapper, if given the choice.)

 2. Static drop semantics may be *surprising* to programmers.

    Rust programmers may be used to dynamic drop semantics, and C++
    programmers may be used to destructors always being run at the end
    of the scope (never earlier).  In particular, an implicit early
    drop could lead to unexpected side-effects occurring earlier than
    expected.

    (Note of course that a dynamic drop semantics may *also* be
     surprising to some programmers.)

The bulk of the Detailed Design is dedicated to mitigating the second
observation, to reduce the number of surprises for a programmer
encountering an early-drop injected by `rustc`.

The main idea for this mitigation is the addition of one or more lints
that report to the user when an side-effectful early-drop will be
implicitly injected into the code, and suggest to them that they
revise their code to remove the implicit `drop` injection (e.g. by
explicitly dropping the path in question, or by re-establishing the
drop obligation on the other control-flow paths, or by rewriting the
code to put in a manual drop-flag via `Option<T>`).


# Detailed design

The change suggested by this RFC has three parts:

1. Change from a dynamic drop semantics to a static drop semantics,

2. Provide one or more lints to inform the programmer of potential
   surprises that may arise from earlier drops that are caused by the
   static drop semantics, and

3. Remove the implicitly added drop-flag, and the implicit zeroing of
   the memory for dropped values.


Each of the three parts is given its own section below.

## Part 1: How static drop semantics works

This section presents a detailed outline of how static drop semantics
looks from the view point of someone trying to understand a Rust
program.

### Drop obligations

No struct or enum has an implicit drop-flag.  When a local variable is
initialized, that establishes a set of "drop obligations": a set of
structural paths (e.g. a local `a`, or a path to a field `b.f.y`) that
need to be dropped (or moved away to a new owner).

The drop obligations for a local variable `x` of struct-type `T` are
computed from analyzing the structure of `T`.  If `T` itself
implements `Drop`, then `x` is a drop obligation.  If `T` does not
implement `Drop`, then the set of drop obligations is the union of the
drop obligations of the fields of `T`.

When a path is moved to a new location, or consumed by a function call,
or when control flow reaches the end of its owner's lexical scope,
the path is removed from the set of drop obligations.

### Example of code with unchanged behavior under static drop semantics

Consider the following example, where `D` represents some struct that
introduces a drop-obligation, while `S` represents some struct that
does not.

```rust

struct Pair<X,Y>{ x:X, y:Y }

struct D; struct S;

impl Drop for D { ... }

fn test() -> bool { ... }

fn xform(d:D) -> D { ... }

fn f1() {

    // At the outset, the set of drop obligations is
    // just the set of moved input parameters (empty
    // in this case).

    //                                      DROP OBLIGATIONS
    //                                  ------------------------
    //                                  {  }
    let pDD : Pair<D,D> = ...;
    //                                  { pDD.x, pDD.y }
    let pDS : Pair<D,S> = ...;
    //                                  { pDD.x, pDD.y, pDS.x }
    let some_d : Option<D>;
    //                                  { pDD.x, pDD.y, pDS.x }
    if test() {
        //                                 { pDD.x, pDD.y, pDS.x }
        {
            let temp = xform(pDD.x);
            //                             {        pDD.y, pDS.x, temp }
            some_d = Some(temp);
            //                             {        pDD.y, pDS.x, temp, some_d }
        } // END OF SCOPE for `temp`
        //                                 {        pDD.y, pDS.x, some_d }
    } else {
        {
            //                             { pDD.x, pDD.y, pDS.x }
            let z = D;
            //                             { pDD.x, pDD.y, pDS.x, z }

            // This drops `pDD.y` before
            // moving `pDD.x` there.
            pDD.y = pDD.x;

            //                             {        pDD.y, pDS.x, z }
            some_d = None;
            //                             {        pDD.y, pDS.x, z, some_d }
        } // END OF SCOPE for `z`
        //                                 {        pDD.y, pDS.x, some_d }
    }

    // MERGE POINT: set of drop obligations must
    // match on all incoming control-flow paths...
    //
    // ... which they do in this case.

    //                                  {       pDD.y, pDS.x, some_d }

    // (... some code that does not change drop obligations ...)

    //                                  {       pDD.y, pDS.x, some_d }
}
```

Some notes about the example above:

It may seem silly that the line `some_d = None;` introduces a
drop-obligation for `some_d`, since `None` itself contains nothing to
drop.  The analysis infers whether such an assignment introduces a
drop-obligation based on the type of `some_d` (`Option<D>`, which
represents a drop-obligation, or at least a potential one).  Anyway,
the point is that having this assignment introduce a drop-obligation
there makes things happier at the merge point that follows it in the
control flow.

### Example of code with changed behavior under static drop semantics

The function `f2` below is similar to `f1`, except that it will have differing set
of drop obligations at the merge point, necessitating a hidden
drop call.

```rust
fn f2() {

    // At the outset, the set of drop obligations is
    // just the set of moved input parameters (empty
    // in this case).

    //                                      DROP OBLIGATIONS
    //                                  ------------------------
    //                                  {  }
    let pDD : Pair<D,D> = ...;
    //                                  {pDD.x, pDD.y}
    let pDS : Pair<D,S> = ...;
    //                                  {pDD.x, pDD.y, pDS.x}
    let some_d : Option<D>;
    //                                  {pDD.x, pDD.y, pDS.x}
    if test() {
        //                                  {pDD.x, pDD.y, pDS.x}
        {
            let temp = xform(pDD.y);
            //                              {pDD.x,        pDS.x, temp}
            some_d = Some(temp);
            //                              {pDD.x,        pDS.x, temp, some_d}
        } // END OF SCOPE for `temp`
        //                                  {pDD.x,        pDS.x, some_d}

        // MERGE POINT PREDECESSOR 1

        // implicit drops injected: drop(pDD.x)
    } else {
        {
            //                              {pDD.x, pDD.y, pDS.x}
            let z = D;
            //                              {pDD.x, pDD.y, pDS.x, z}

            // This drops `pDD.y` before
            // moving `pDD.x` there.
            pDD.y = pDD.x;

            //                              {       pDD.y, pDS.x, z}
            some_d = None;
            //                              {       pDD.y, pDS.x, z, some_d}
        } // END OF SCOPE for `z`
        //                                  {       pDD.y, pDS.x, some_d}

        // MERGE POINT PREDECESSOR 2

        // implicit drops injected: drop(pDD.y)
    }

    // MERGE POINT: set of drop obligations must
    // match on all incoming control-flow paths.
    //
    // For the original user code, they did not
    // in this case.  In the original code,
    // Predecessor 1 has drop obligations
    // {pDD.x,        pDS.x, some_d}
    // and Predecessor 2 has drop obligations
    // {       pDD.y, pDS.x, some_d}.
    //
    // Therefore, implicit drops are injected up
    // above, to ensure that the set of drop
    // obligations match, yielding the final
    // set:
    // {              pDS.x, some_d}.

    // After the implicit drops, the resulting
    // remaining drop obligations are the
    // following:

    //                                  {              pDS.x, some_d}

    // (... some code that does not change drop obligations ...)

    //                                  {              pDS.x, some_d}
}
```

### Control-flow sensitivity

Note that the static drop semantics is based on a control-flow
analysis, *not* just the lexical nesting structure of the code.

In particular: If control flow splits at a point like an if-expression,
but the two arms never meet, then they can have completely
sets of drop obligations.

This is important, since in coding patterns like loops, one
often sees different sets of drop obligations prior to a `break`
compared to a point where the loop repeats, such as a `continue`
or the end of a `loop` block.

```rust
    // At the outset, the set of drop obligations is
    // just the set of moved input parameters (empty
    // in this case).

    //                                      DROP OBLIGATIONS
    //                                  ------------------------
    //                                  {  }
    let mut pDD : Pair<D,D> = mk_dd();
    //                                  {         pDD.x, pDD.y }
    'a: loop {
        // MERGE POINT: set of drop obligations must
        // match on all incoming control-flow paths.

        //                                  {     pDD.x, pDD.y }
        if test() {
            //                                  { pDD.x, pDD.y }
            consume(pDD.x);
            //                                  {        pDD.y }
            break 'a;
        }
        // *not* merge point (only one path, the else branch, flows here)

        //                                  {     pDD.x, pDD.y }

        // never falls through; must merge with 'a loop.
    }

    // RESUME POINT: break 'a above flows here

    //                                  {                pDD.y }

    // This is the point immediately preceding `'b: loop`; (1.) below.

    'b: loop {
        // MERGE POINT: set of drop obligations must match on all
        // incoming control-flow paths.
        //
        // There are *three* such incoming paths: (1.) the statement
        // preceding `'b: loop`, (2.) the `continue 'b;` below, and
        // (3.) the end of the loop's block below.

        //                                  {            pDD.y }

        consume(pDD.y);

        //                                  {                  }

        if test() {
            //                                  {              }
            pDD.x = mk_d();
            //                                  { pDD.x        }
            break 'b;
        }

        // *not* merge point (only one path flows here)

        //                                  {                  }

        if test() {
            //                                  {              }
            pDD.y = mk_d();

            // This is (2.) referenced above.   {        pDD.y }
            continue 'b;
        }
        // *not* merge point (only one path flows here)

        //                                  {                  }

        pDD.y = mk_d();

        // This is (3.) referenced above.   {            pDD.y }
    }

    // RESUME POINT: break 'b above flows here

    //                                  {         pDD.x        }
```

Likewise, a `return` statement represents another control flow jump.
In addition, the set of drop obligations for each `return` can be
completely different: even though every return conceptually flows to
the same place (namely the instruction following the call-site), each
`return` can have specialized code paths for its own drop obligations
(and then compiler optimizations can merge the common code paths).

```rust
pub fn foo(b: || -> bool, c: || -> D, f: |D| -> i8) -> i8 {

    }

    //                                  {     x, y }

    return 0; // emits code to drop `x` and `y`
}
```

### match expressions and enum variants that move

The examples above used just structs and `if` expressions, but there
is an additional twist introduced by `enum` types.  The examples above
showed that a struct type can be partially moved: one of its fields
can be moved away while the other is still present, and this can be
faithfully represented in the set of drop obligations.
But consider an `enum` and `match`:

```rust
pub enum Pairy<X> { Two(X,X), One(X,X) }
pub fn foo<A>(c: || -> Pairy<A>,
              dA: |A| -> i8,
              dR: |&A| -> i8) -> i8 {
    let s = c();
    let ret = match s {
        Two(ref r1, ref r2) => {
            dR(r1) + dR(r2)
        }
        One(a1, a2) => {
            dA(a1) + dA(a2)
        }
    };
    c();
    ret
}
```

In the above code, which is legal today in Rust, we have an arm for
`Two` that matches the input `s` by reference, while the arm for `One`
moves `s` into the match.  That is, if the `Two` arm matches, then `s`
is left in place to be dropped at the end of the execution of `foo()`,
while if the `One` arm matches, then the `s` is deconstructed and
moved in pieces into `a1` and `a2`, which are themselves then consumed
by the calls to `dA`.

According to static drop semantics, if any arm in a match consumes the
input via `move`, then every arm must consume the input, possibly by
adding implicit early drops as necessary at the end of arms that do
not consume the input.  In particular, the above code will remain
legal, but there will be an implicit early drop of `s` added at the
end of the first arm.

This is notable for two reasons.  First, the programmer cannot
currently write such a drop explicitly today, since that would require
non-lexical borrows.  Second, the borrow-checker must take care to not
allow borrowed references to live beyond the inserted early drops.

(An earlier version of this RFC proposed a so-called "match-arm rule"
that made the above code illegal, requiring that if any arm consumed
the input, then all arms must also consume the input.)

### Type parameters

With respect to static drop semantics, there is not much to say about
type parameters: unless they have the `Copy` bound, we must assume
that they implement `Drop`, and therefore introduce drop obligations
(the same as types that actually do implement `Drop`, as illustrated
above).

## Part 2: Early drop lints

The interaction of moves and "resource acquisition is initialization"
(RAII) patterns can have surprising consequences. Under the current
dynamic drop semantics, drops normally occur at the end of scope, but
not if a value has been moved. Under static drop semantics, drops of
moved values occur earlier. In many cases, it is unclear what the user
intended.

Some users may be surprised by the implicit drops that are injected
by static drop semantics, especially if the drop code being executed
has observable side-effects.

Such side-effects include:

  * Memory being deallocated earlier than expected (probably harmless,
    but some may care)

  * Output buffers being flushed in an output port earlier than
    expected.

  * Mutex locks being released earlier than expected (a worrisome
    change in timing semantics when writing concurrent algorithms).

In particular, the injection of the implicit drops could silently
invalidate certain kinds of RAII patterns.

It is important to keep in mind that one can always recreate the
effect of the former drop flag by wrapping one's type `T` in an
`Option<T>`; therefore, the problem is *not* that such RAII patterns
cannot be expressed.  It is merely that a user may assume that a
variable binding induces RAII-style effect, and that assumption is then
invalidated due to a errant move on one control-flow branch.

Therefore, to defend against users being surprised by the early
implicit drops induced by static drop semantics, this RFC proposes
adding lints that tell the user about the points in the control-flow
where implicit drops are injected.  The specific proposal is to add two
lints, named `early_quiet_drop` and `early_noisy_drop`, with the
default settings `#[allow(early_quiet_drop)]` and
`#[warn(early_noisy_drop)]`.  (The two lints are similar in name
because they provide very similar functionality; the only difference
is how aggressively each reports injected drop invocations.)

### The `early_noisy_drop` lint

Here is an example piece of code (very loosely adapted from the Rust
`sync` crate):

```rust
        let (guard, state) = self.lock(); // (`guard` is mutex `LockGuard`)
        ...
        if state.disconnected {
            ...
        } else {
            ...
            match f() {
                Variant1(payload) => g(payload, guard),
                Variant2          => {}
            }

            ... // (***)

            Ok(())
        }
```

In the `Variant1` arm above, `guard` is consumed by `g`.  Therefore,
when the bit of code labeled with a `(***)` represents a span that,
when reached via the `Variant2` branch of the match statement, has the
`guard` still held under dynamic drop semantics, but the `guard` is
*released* under static drop semantics.

The `early_noisy_drop` lint is meant to catch cases such as this,
where the user has inadvertently written code where static drop
semantics injects an implicit call to a side-effectful `drop` method.

Assuming that `LockGuard`, or some subcomponent of it, implements the
`NoisyDrop` trait, but does not implement the `QuietDrop` trait (see
below `early_quiet_drop` lint), then the `#[warn(early_noisy_drop)]` lint
will report a warning for the code above, telling the user that
the `guard` is moved away on the `Variant1` branch but not on the
other branches.

In general the lint cannot know what the actual intention of the user
was.  Therefore, the lint suggests that the user either (1.) add an
explicit drop call, for clarity, or (2.)  reinitialize `guard` on the
`Variant1` arm, or (3.)  emulate a drop-flag by using
`Option<LockGuard>` instead of `LockGuard` as the type of `guard`.

### The `early_quiet_drop` lint and `QuietDrop` trait

To be effective, a lint must not issue a significant number of false
positives: i.e., we do not want to tell the user about every site in
their crate where a `String` was dropped on one branch but not
another.

More generally, it is likely that most sites where `Vec<u8>` is
dropped are not of interest either.  Instead, the user is likely to
want to focus on points in the control flow where *effectful* drops
are executed (such as flushing output buffers or releasing locks).

Meanwhile, some users may still care about every potential
side-effect, even those that their libraries have deemed "pure".  Some
users may just want, out of principle, to mark every early drop
explicitly, in the belief that such explicitness improves code
comprehension.

Therefore, rather than provide just a single lint for warning about
all occurrences of injected early drops, this proposal suggests a
simple two-tier structure.  Droppable types are categorized as
either "quiet" or "noisy."  A noisy drop has significant side-effects
where the programmer is likely to care about ordering.
A quiet drop has no significant side-effects.

There are two marker traits, `NoisyDrop` and `QuietDrop`, that the
programmer can use to mark their types, in much the same manner as
described on RFC PR #127, "Opt-in builtin traits, take 2: default and
negative impls".  By default, `Drop` implementations are assumed to be
quiet.  (This is a semi-arbitrary choice.)

An easy example of such a type whose `drop` method is likely to be
considered pure is `Vec<u8>`, since the only side-effect of dropping a
`Vec<u8>` is deallocation of its backing buffer.  (More generally,
`Vec<T>` should be `QuietDrop` for any `T` that is also `QuietDrop`,
and `NoisyDrop` for any `T` that is `NoisyDrop`.)

Then programmers can implement `NoisyDrop` on a type like `LockGuard`
to declare that it has side-effects when dropped, and can use
`QuietDrop` to make a type with a noisy subcomponent quiet again,
e.g. if the containing type forms an abstraction that makes the
side-effect insignificant again.  An example of the latter occurs in
`std::sync::Mutex<T>`, where the lock is meant only to guard an
instance of the wrapped type `T`, and therefore it does no harm to
drop of the `Mutex` early.

If a type implements `QuietDrop`, then early implicit drops of
that type will no longer be reported by `#[warn(early_noisy_drop)]`
(instead, such a type becomes the responsibility of the
`#[allow(early_quiet_drop)]` lint).  Thus, the first lint will
hopefully provide well-focused warnings with a low false-positive
rate, while the second, being set to `allow` by default, will
not generate much noise.

Meanwhile, to ensure that a particular fn item has no hidden early
drops at all, one can turn on `#[deny(early_quiet_drop)]` and
`#[deny(early_noisy_drop)]`, and then all statically injected drops
are reported (and the code rejected if any are present), regardless of
whether the types involved implement `QuietDrop` or not.

### Type parameters, revisited

We noted in the "How static drop semantics works" section that
type parameters are not particularly special with respect to
static drop semantics.

However, with the lints there is potential for type parameters to be
treated specially.

Nonetheless, this RFC currently proposes that type parameters not be
treated specially by the lints: if you have mismatched drop
obligations, then that represents a hidden implicit drop that you may
not have known was there, and it behooves you to make an explicit call
to `drop`.

(See further discussion in the
["Unresolved Questions"](#unresolved-questions).)

## Part 3: Removing the drop-flag; removing memory zeroing

With the above two pieces in place, the remainder is trivial.  Namely:
once static drop semantics is actually implemented, then the compiler
can be revised to no longer inject a drop flag into structs and enums that
implement `Drop`, and likewise memory zeroing can be removed.

# Drawbacks

* The lint may be annoying to users whose programs are not affected by
  the early drops. (We mitigate this by providing ways for users to
  opt-out of the lint `#[allow(early_noisy_drop)]`, both in a
  lexically scoped fashion, like other lints, and in a type-based
  fashion via a `QuietDrop` trait.)

* The early drops may surprise the users who are used to the dynamic
  drop semantics. (We mitigate this by providing warnings via the
  lint, a clear path for rewriting code in terms of `Option<T>` to
  emulate a drop-flag, and a way for users to enable a stricter lint:
  `#[warn(early_quiet_drop)]` that reports all early drops, including
  those hidden via `QuietDrop`.)

* There may be benefits to implicit memory-zeroing that are not
  accounted for in this RFC, in which case we may end up only removing
  the drop-flag but not the implicit memory-zeroing.  Still, even if
  the only benefit is removing the drop-flag, it may still be worth
  the pain of static drop semantics.

# Alternatives

## Do nothing

Keep dynamic drop semantics, the drop flag, and the implicit memory
zeroing, paying their hidden costs in time and space.

## Require explicit drops rather than injecting them

Rather than injecting implicit drops where necessary, we could just
reject programs that have control-flow merge points with an
inconsistent set of incoming drop-obligations.

This would be equivalent to doing `#[forbid(early_quiet_drops)]`
and `#[forbid(early_noisy_drops)]`.

Felix (the author) was originally planning to take this approach, but
it became clear after a little experimentation that the annoyance
implied here made this a non-starter.

## Do this with support for variant-predicated drop-obligations

We could enrich the structure of
drop-obligations to include paths that are predicated on enum
variants, like so: `{(s is Two => s#0), (s is Two => s#1)}`.  This
represents the idea that (1.) all control flows where `s` is the `One`
variant dropped `s` entirely but also, (2.) all control flows where
`s` is the `Two` variant still has the 0'th and 1'st tuple components
remaining as drop obligations.

I do not currently know how to efficiently implement such an enriched
drop-obligation representation.  It seems it would get nasty when
one considers that these predicates can accumulate.

Also, if we do figure out how to implement this, we could add this
later backward compatibly.  I do not want to attempt to implement it
in the short-term.

## Associate drop flags with stack-local variables alone

I mentioned in "Hidden bits are bad, part II" that some users have
said they thought that the drop flag was only part of a local
variable's state, not part of every occurrence of a struct/enum,
regardless of where it is allocated.

We could try to explore this option, but it seems potentially very
complicated to me. E.g. would each droppable structs embedded within a
type get its own drop flag when stack-allocated (thus making the
layout of a type potentially depend on where it is allocated; that, or
the drop flags would have to be stored out-of-band compared to the
location of the struct itself in memory).

Besides, we would still need to do something about droppable types
that are *not* stack-allocated, which implies that we would still need
to do some sort of static drop semantics for those values.  And if we
are going to do that anyway, we might as well apply it across the
board.

## Separate individual and grouped instances of a type

(This is a variant on "Associate drop flags with stack-local variables
alone" above, but with a clearer vision for how it would work.)

Instead of having a single `size_of` value for a given type, treat
each type as having two different sizes: `indiv_size_of::<T>` and
`group_size_of::<T>`.

An individual instance can be moved on its own.  It gets a drop-flag.

An instance that is part of a group cannot be moved on its own.  The
whole group gets a drop flag, but each instance within it does not.
(I am assuming the group is itself allocated as an individual
instance, though perhaps one could recursively structure a group made
up of groups; that is an unclear aspect of this thought-exercise.)

When looking at a slice `[T]`, the instances are part of the group,
and one uses `group_size_of::<T>` for offset calculations.

For enums, structs, and tuples, the fields are considered individuals.
(Though perhaps we could have "atomic" enums/structs/tuples where the
fields are considered part of the group as a whole and cannot be
independently moved to new owners on control flow branches.)

This is an interesting thought exercise, but a pretty serious
language/library change, and it is not clear whether it would be any
better than static drop semantics in terms of Rust's language
complexity budget.

## Store drop-flags for fragments of state on stack out-of-band

(This is another variant on "Associate drop flags with stack-local variables alone",
but with appropriate support for tracking fragments of state.)

Keep a dynamic drop semantics, but without the drop-flags.  To
accomplish this, internally, the compiler does the same
drop-obligation analysis that is described above, to identify paths to
state where the drop-obligations differ at a merge point.  On the
stack frame itself, keep an array of boolean drop-flags for the
function that tracks all such paths with differing drop obligations.
Then, at the end of a variable's scope, consult the drop-flag array as
necessary.

Under this alternative, since we are continuing to use a dynamic drop
semantics, we do not add `NoisyDrop` nor `QuietDrop`.  The main
difference of this alternative over what code does today is that code
would not be allowed to attempt to inspect the state of the drop flag.

Whether or not to take this approach is largely dependent on whether
one thinks that it is too easy to be relying on a drop-flag
unintentionally; i.e., is it better to require code that wants a
drop-flag to use `Option<T>`?  Does that help code clarity?  Or does
it just create unnecessary work?

# Unresolved questions

## Names (bikeshed expected)

There may be better names for lints and the traits being added
here.  It took me a while to come up with the "noisy" and "quiet"
mnemonics.

## Which library types should be `QuietDrop`

Side-effectfulness is in the eye of the beholder.  In particular,
I wonder how to handle `rc`; should it be:

```rust
impl<T> QuietDrop for Rc<T>
```

or should it be like other container types, like so:
```rust
impl<T:QuietDrop> QuietDrop for Rc<T>
```

One school of thought says that when you use `Rc`, you have
effectively given up on RAII for that type, at least when RAII is
viewed as being tied to a particular lexical scope, and therefore
all instances of `Rc<T>` should be considered to have pure drop
behavior, regardless of their contents.

But another school of thought says that since the destruction timing
of `Rc<T>` is predictable (compared to `Gc<T>` which in principle is
not predictable), then it would make sense to continue using the same
bubble-up semantics that the other collection types use.


## Should type parameters be treated specially

It is possible that generic code in general does not
need to be written with the same sort of care about drop timing that
code specific to a particular effectful type needs to be.  (Or rather,
it is possible that someone writing generic code will either want to
opt into receiving warnings about merge-points with mismatched drop
obligations.)



## How should moving into wildcards be handled

In an example like:

```rust
enum Pair<X,Y> { Two(X,Y), One(X), Zed }
let x : Pair<FD, FD> = ...; // FD is some eFfectful Drop thing.
match x {
    Two(payload, _) => {
        ... code working with, then dropping, payload ...
    }
    One(payload) => {
        ... code working with, then dropping, payload ...
    }
    Zed => {
    }
}
```

In the above example, when the first match arm matches, we move `x`
into it, binding its first tuple component as `payload`.  But how
should the second tuple component of `x` be handled?  We need to drop
it at some point, since we need for all of `x` to be dropped at
the point in the control-flow where all of the match arms meet.

The most obvious options are:

 1. In any given arm, implicitly drop state bound to `_` at the end of the
    arm's scope.

    This would be as if the programmer had actually written:

    ```rust
    Two(payload, _ignore_me) => {
        ... code working with, then dropping, payload ...
    }
    ```

 2. In any given arm, implicitly drop state bound to `_` at the
    beginning of the arm's scope.

    This would be as if the programmer had actually written:

    ```rust
    Two(payload, _ignore_me) => {
        ... code working with, then dropping, payload ...
    }
    ```

 3. Disallow moving into `_` patterns; force programmer to name them
    and deal with them.

    While this is clearly a clean conservative solution, it is also
    awkward when you consider attempting to simplify the code above
    like so (illegal under the suggested scheme):

```rust
enum Pair<X,Y> { Two(X,Y), One(X), Zed }
let x : Pair<FD, FD> = ...; // FD is some eFfectful Drop thing.
match x {
    Two(payload, _) |
    One(payload) => {
        ... code working with, then dropping, payload ...
    }
    Zed => {
    }
}
```

## The most direct `Option<T>` re-encoding of drop-flag yields dead_assignments

When porting this old code:

```rust
let x;
if condition1 {
    if condition2 {
        x = D1;
    } else {
        x = D2;
    }
    use_of(&x);
}
// no explicit uses of `x` here, though `x` may have an effect when dropped.
```

in a manner that preserves the spirit of the drop flag,
(including only dropping `x` at the end of its scope as
declared above),

```rust
let mut x = None;
if condition1 {
    if condition2 {
        x = Some(D1);
    } else {
        x = Some(D2);
    }
    use_of(x.as_ref().unwrap());
}
// no explicit uses of `x` here, though `x` may have an effect when dropped.
```

The problem here is that this causes the dead-assignment lint to fire,
since there is no uses of `x` that is not first preceded by an
assignment with a non-None value.

Under this RFC as proposed, to have warning-free code, one would have to
write:

```rust
let x;
if condition1 {
    if condition2 {
        x = Some(D1);
    } else {
        x = Some(D2);
    }
    use_of(&x);
} else {
    x = None;
}
```

(Maybe some people would regard the latter as an improvement on the first re-write.)

## How dynamic drop semantics works

(This section is just presenting background information on the
semantics of `drop` and the drop-flag as it works in Rust today; it
does not contain any discussion of the changes being proposed by this
RFC.)

A struct or enum implementing `Drop` will have its drop-flag
automatically set to a non-zero value when it is constructed.  When
attempting to drop the struct or enum (i.e. when control reaches the
end of the lexical scope of its owner), the injected glue code will
only execute its associated `fn drop` if its drop-flag is non-zero.

In addition, the compiler injects code to ensure that when a value is
moved to a new location in memory or dropped, then the original memory
is entirely zeroed.

A struct/enum definition implementing `Drop` can be tagged with the
attribute `#[unsafe_no_drop_flag]`.  When so tagged, the struct/enum
will not have a hidden drop flag embedded within it. In this case, the
injected glue code will execute the associated glue code
unconditionally, even though the struct/enum value may have been moved
to a new location in memory or dropped (in either case, the memory
representing the value will have been zeroed).

The above has a number of implications:

 * A program can manually cause the drop code associated with a value
   to be skipped by first zeroing out its memory.

 * A `Drop` implementation for a struct tagged with `unsafe_no_drop_flag`
   must assume that it will be called more than once.  (However, every
   call to `drop` after the first will be given zeroed memory.)
