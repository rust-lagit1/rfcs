# Summary

This RFC proposes to add i18n handling inse rust compiler.

#Motivations

With the growth of the number of rust's users, adding localization would be a big plus.

#Proposal

So the following error:

```Shell
test.rs:2:4: 2:6 error: expected one of `.`, `;`, `}`, or an operator, found `::`
```

Would become in rust-code:

```Rust
format_lang!("parser.expected_operator", expected, found)
```

We would store all translations in localization files which would contain key value pairs. For example:

```
// in english file
"parser.expected_operator" = "expected one of {} or an operator, found {}"

// in french file
"parser.expected_operator" = "un opérateur ou l'un des symboles suivants était attendu: {}, obtenu: {}"
```

If no translation is found, the english localization is used.

The localization would be used like this:

```Shell
> rustc --lang fr some_file
```

For error codes / long diagnostics, we keep a different file format for convenience and instead of statically baking in the string, we do a file lookup.

The localization files should be stored in a folder called i10n. By default, the english files would be there, but if you put the french files there, the option `--lang fr` will work.
