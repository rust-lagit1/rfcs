# Summary
[summary]: #summary

Extend Rust target specification to follow more closely LLVM triple specification.

# Motivation
[motivation]: #motivation

[LLVM triple](http://llvm.org/docs/LangRef.html#target-triple) specification is
more precise than the current [Rust
target](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/7ac844ffb850a73b98cd47cbdec909d1f03c7987/src/librustc_back/target/mod.rs#L228)
specification we have.

In particular, the following elements are missing from the Rust target
definition:
- optional [OS version](https://github.com/llvm-mirror/llvm/blob/343e535d9c38cf57173ace6597380752a18a6a67/include/llvm/ADT/Triple.h#L315)
- optional [environment version](https://github.com/llvm-mirror/llvm/blob/343e535d9c38cf57173ace6597380752a18a6a67/include/llvm/ADT/Triple.h#L303)


Rust language is aimed to be used on different operating systems following themselves
their own rules. In particular, each operating systems have proper way to
deal with breaking changes: if Linux tends to forbid breaking changes by
policy, all others systems doesn't have such rule. As Rust language tends to be
a stable language, having a stable way to describe breaking changes on the OS
would be very valuable and could become necessary as time passes.

LLVM deals with such changes on OS by having a different triple per OS version,
like for the following triples:

- `x86_64-apple-darwin16.0.0`
- `x86_64-unknown-freebsd12.0`
- `x86_64-unknown-freebsd11.0`
- `i386-unknown-openbsd5.8`
- `x86_64-unknown-netbsd7.99`


As examples, consider the following changes in several operating systems (some
are ABI changes, others API changes) and how a crate like `libc` would have to
deal with them. Please note that some are quite old but could be considered as 
representative of something that already occurred in the past.

- **OpenBSD 5.5** does a big breaking changes in order to be compatible with
  [year 2038](https://www.openbsd.org/faq/upgrade55.html#time_t): it switches
  from a signed 32 bit counter to a signed 64 bit time type.

- **OpenBSD 6.2** (upcoming) changes `si_addr` type (`char *` to `void *`) in
  `siginfo_t` structure.

In the current situation, `libc` crate has no way to deal in a stable way with
these changes. It could only support two incompatible OS version together by
only defining the common subset. Depending on the breaking part, it could result
in removed feature in rustc (removing `si_addr` for OpenBSD would break stack
overflow detection), or even breaking rustc itself (removing `ino_t` for
FreeBSD).

Additionally, in order to switch `libc` from one OS version to another, it
would be required to do a breaking change at `libc` level (incrementing major
version of `libc` itself) which is undesirable for this purpose.


The purpose of extending Rust `Target` type to follow LLVM Triple definition is
to be able to deal with such changes at Rust language level. As the target will
be able to distinguish between particular OS or environment versions, it
would be possible to export the information in the same way we export
`target_os`, `target_arch`, `target_endian` or `target_pointer_width`.

This way, a crate like `libc` could export raw bindings of platform
specifically for the targeted version.


# Detailed design
[design]: #detailed-design

This is the bulk of the RFC. Explain the design in enough detail for somebody familiar
with the language to understand, and for somebody familiar with the compiler to implement.
This should get into specifics and corner-cases, and include examples of how the feature is used.

**INCOMPLETE PART: only ideas are presented here for now**

## Language level: what the user will see ?

At language level, new attributes for conditional compilation would be added:

- `target_os_version`
- `target_env_version`

There could be empty ("").

```rust
extern {
    // encrypt() function doesn't exist in freebsd12

    #[cfg(all(target_os="freebsd", not(target_os_version="12")))]
    pub fn encrypt(block *mut ::c_char, flag ::c_int) -> ::c_int;
}
```


Additionally, in order to simplify conditional compilation when changes are
accross several versions, new predicates would be added too in order to do
version comparaison.

```rust
extern {
    // encrypt() function doesn't exist anymore starting with freebsd12

    #[cfg(all(target_os="freebsd", version_lt(target_os_version, "12")))]
    pub fn encrypt(block *mut ::c_char, flag ::c_int) -> ::c_int;
}
```


Another complete (and simple) example: in OpenBSD 6.2, the structure
`siginfo_t` changed:

```rust
pub struct siginfo_t {
    pub si_signo: ::c_int,
    pub si_code: ::c_int,
    pub si_errno: ::c_int,

    // A type correction occured in 6.2.
    // Before it was a `char *` and now it is a `void *`.
    #[cfg(version_lt(target_os_version, "6.2"))]
    pub si_addr: *mut ::c_char,
    #[cfg(version_ge(target_os_version, "6.2"))]
    pub si_addr: *mut ::c_void,

    #[cfg(target_pointer_width = "32")]
    __pad: [u8; 112],
    #[cfg(target_pointer_width = "64")]
    __pad: [u8; 108],
}
```

It would be possible to target `x86_amd64-unknown-openbsd6.1` **and**
`x86_amd64-unknown-openbsd6.2` whereas with [current libc
code](https://github.com/rust-lang/libc/blob/6ddc76a27e0678c04ec7337591f8a0e36c065664/src/unix/bsd/netbsdlike/openbsdlike/mod.rs#L106)
only one version is possible, and switching from one to the other version would
be a breaking change in `libc` (and we would lose OpenBSD 6.1 supported
version).


## Syntax level

The addition of new predicates in attribute is a syntax extension.

It permits to easily make a piece of code available to a range version.

Predicates would be:

- `version_eq()` : equal
- `version_lt()` : less-than
- `version_le()` : less-or-equal
- `version_gt()` : greater-than
- `version_ge()` : greater-or-equal

The choice of an explicit name is to unhidden that the comparaison is done on
strings with a specific format (`major.minor.micro`).

Having a predicate instead of an operator (`version_lt()` vs `<`) avoid a too
intrusive syntax's modification too.

```rust
#[cfg(version_lt("2", "10"))]
println!("numeric comparaison: 2 < 10");

#[cfg(version_lt("3", "2.0")]
println!("able to deal with any number of '.': 3 < 2.0 (false)");
#[cfg(version_lt("2.0", "2.0")]
println!("able to deal with any number of '.': 2.0 < 2.0 (false)");
#[cfg(version_lt("10.0", "10.0.1")]
println!("able to deal with any number of '.':10.0 < 10.0.1");

#[cfg(version_eq("2", "2.0")]
println!("LLVM assumes \"2\" to be equivalent to \"2.0.0\");

#[cfg(version_le("3", "4", "5")]
println!("allow more than 2 arguments in the predicate: 3 <= 4 <= 5");
```

See `libsyntax/attr.rs`.


## Session level

- populate and export the new attributes in the default build configuration

See `librustc/session/config.rs`.



## Backend level

- additional members in `Target`
  - `target_os_version: String` (could be empty: "")
  - `target_env_version: String` (could be empty: "")

- drawbacks: it requires a new target per OS version
  - **XXX** is it possible to autodetect ?
    - some targets tagged as "template"
    - if the provided `target` name match the template, complete it

- add a flexible code to easily create new target (with just
  `target_os_version` changing)

See `librustc_back/target/`.




## Workflow with new OS release

- when a new OS release occurs
  - adds to `libc` any changes (using `target_os_version` if required)
  - adds a new target specification
  - remove target of any unsupported OS version



# How We Teach This
[how-we-teach-this]: #how-we-teach-this

What names and terminology work best for these concepts and why? 
How is this idea best presented—as a continuation of existing Rust patterns, or as a wholly new one?

Would the acceptance of this proposal change how Rust is taught to new users at any level? 
How should this feature be introduced and taught to existing Rust users?


Modifying the `Target` struct is a low-level change by itself.

From a developer perspective, it adds a new attribute for conditional
compilation.

For projects using Rust (Mozilla in mind), it changes the `--target` argument
for several existing targets in a breaking way: some targets will disappear
(`x86_64-unknown-openbsd`) in favor of others targets
(`x86_64-unknown-openbsd6.0` and `x86_64-unknown-openbsd6.1` at time of
writing). But it reflects better the reality: OpenBSD 6.0 is different from
OpenBSD 6.1.


What additions or changes to the Rust Reference, _The Rust Programming Language_, and/or _Rust by Example_ does it entail?

- _Rust Reference_: mentioning new attributes in conditional compilation attribute section.


# Drawbacks
[drawbacks]: #drawbacks

Why should we *not* do this?

- additional complexity in attributes for conditional compilation
- number of targets will grow a lot
  - not all targets will be testable (requires a particular OS version for
    running testsuite)
  - will require to deprecate unsupported OS version (for example OpenBSD
    officially support only the 2 last releases)


# Alternatives
[alternatives]: #alternatives

What other designs have been considered? What is the impact of not doing this?

- using `target_os` with the version inside. it would require to duplicate all
  `libc` code (for only small differences) at each release.

- status quo: while no fundamental breaking changes occur at OS level, no need
  to do anything. Note that FreeBSD 12 will be released with such changes.


# Unresolved questions
[unresolved]: #unresolved-questions

What parts of the design are still TBD?

- partial implementation with no additional predicate at syntax level. It
  requires to explicitly list all affected OS/env version on changes. Doable if
  the list of supported OS/env version is controlled in some way.
