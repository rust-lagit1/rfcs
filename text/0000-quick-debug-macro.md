# Summary
[summary]: #summary

Adds a macro `dbg!([expr1 , expr2, .., exprN])` for quick and dirty `Debug`ing
of expressions to the terminal. The macro evaluates expressions, prints it to
`STDERR`, and finally yields a flat tuple of `([expr1, expr2, .. exprN])`.
On release builds, the macro is the identity function and has no side effects.
The macro is added to the prelude of the standard library.

# Motivation
[motivation]: #motivation

The motivation to add this new `dbg!` macro is two-fold.

## For aspiring rustaceans
[for-aspiring-rustaceans]: #for-aspiring-rustaceans

One of the often asked questions is how to print out variables to the terminal.
Delaying the need to explain formatting arguments in the statement
`println!("{:?}", expr);` can help aspiring rustaceans to quickly learn the
language. With `dbg!(expr);` there is no longer such need, which can be delayed
until the developer actually cares about the format of the output and not just
what value the expression evaluates to.

## For experienced developers

By using `dbg!(expr);`, the burden of a common papercut: writing
`println!("{:?}", expr);` every time you want to see the evaluted-to value of an
expression, can be significantly reduced. The developer no longer has to remember
the formatting args and has to type significantly less (12 characters to be exact).

To increase the utility of the macro, it acts as a pass-through function on the
expression by simply printing it and then yielding it. On release builds, the
macro is the identity function - thus, the macro can be used in release builds
without hurting performance while allowing the debugging of the program in debug
builds. To see why this is useful, consider starting off with:

```rust
let c = fun(a) + fun(b);
let y = self.first().second();
```

Now, you want to inspect what `fun(a)` and `fun(b)` is, but not go through the
hassle of 1) saving `fun(a)` and `fun(b)` to a variable, 2) printing out the
variable, 3) then finally use it in the expression as `let c = fa + fb;`.
The same applies to inspecting the temporary state of `self.first()`.
Instead of this hassle, you can simply do:

```rust
let c = dbg!(fun(a)) + dbg!(fun(b));
let y = dbg!(self.first()).second();
```

This modification is considerably smaller and disturbs flow while
developing code to a lesser degree.

Additionally, by allowing the user to pass in multiple expressions and label
them, the utility is further augmented.

## Why not use the `log` crate?

While the `log` crate offers a lot of utility, it first has to be used with
`extern crate log;`. A logger then has to be set up before expressions can be
logged. It is therefore not suitable for introducing newcommers to the language.

## Not useful as a crate

This RFC is for quick and dirty debugging and has to be in the standard library
to be useful. Why? Because while the utility provided by the `dbg!` macro is
necessary, it is unlikely that a developer, and that includes the author of
the RFC, would take a dependency on a crate that just provides the macro. The
hassle of constantly re-adding such a crate temporarily would also be greater
than just using `println!("{:#?}", expr);` in a majority of cases. But using
`println!` is still a paper cut. Furthermore, `dbg!` is unlikely to ever be a
crate that you can `extern crate` for in the Rust playground, so the macro
can't be used to quickly help users on `#rust` and other venues, which is one
of the goals of the macro.

# Guide-level explanation
[guide-level-explanation]: #guide-level-explanation

## On debug builds

[on-debug-builds]: #on-debug-builds

First, some preliminaries:

```rust
#[derive(Debug)] // The type of expr in dbg!(expr) must be Debug.
struct Point {
    x: usize,
    y: usize,
}
```

With the following example, which most newcomers will benefit from:

```rust
fn main() {
    dbg!(Point { x: 1, y: 2 });

    let p = Point { x: 4, y: 5 };
    dbg!(p);
}
```

The program will print the points to `STDERR` as:

```
[DEBUGGING, src/main.rs:1]
=> Point{x: 1, y: 2,} = Point {
    x: 1,
    y: 2
}

[DEBUGGING, src/main.rs:4]
=> p = Point {
    x: 4,
    y: 5
}
```

You may also save the debugged value to a variable or use it in an expression
since the debugging is pass-through. This is seen in the following example:

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = dbg!(1 + 2);
    let y = dbg!(x + 1) + dbg!(3);
    dbg!(y);
}
```

This prints the following to `STDERR`:

```
[DEBUGGING, src/main.rs:1]
=> 1 + 2 = 3

[DEBUGGING, src/main.rs:2]
=> x + 1 = 4

[DEBUGGING, src/main.rs:2]
=> 3 = 3

[DEBUGGING, src/main.rs:3]
=> y = 7
```

More expressions may be debugged in one invocation of the macro, as seen in the
following example:
```rust
fn main() {
    let a = 1;
    let b = 2;
    let _ : u32 = dbg!(a);
    let _ : (u32, u32) = dbg!(a, b);
    let _ : (u32, u32, u32) = dbg!(a, b, a + b);

    let p = Point { x: 4, y: 5 };
    let q = Point { x: 2, y: 1 };
    let qp : (&Point, &Point) = dbg!(&p, &q);
}
```

As seen in the example, the type of the expression `dbg!(expr)` is the type of
`expr`. For `dbg!(expr1, expr2 [, .., exprN])` the type is that of the tuple
`(expr1, expr2 [, .., exprN])`.

The example above prints the following to `STDERR`:
```
[DEBUGGING, src/main.rs:3]
=> a = 1

[DEBUGGING, src/main.rs:4]
=> a = 1, b = 2

[DEBUGGING, src/main.rs:5]
=> a = 1, b = 2, a + b = 3

[DEBUGGING, src/main.rs:9]
=> &p = Point {
    x: 4,
    y: 5
}, &q = Point {
    x: 2,
    y: 1
}
```

Furthermore, instead of using `stringify!` on the expressions, which is done by
default, the user may provide labels, as done in:

```rust
fn main() {
    let w = 1;
    let h = 2;
    dbg!("width" => w, "height" => h, "area" => w * h);

    let p = Point { x: 4, y: 5 };
    dbg!("first point" => &p, "same point" => &p);
}
```

This allows the user to provide more descriptive names if necessary. With this
example, the following is printed to `STDERR`:
```
[DEBUGGING, src/main.rs:3]
=> "width" = 1, "height" = 2, "area" = 2

[DEBUGGING, src/main.rs:6]:
=> "first point" = Point {
    x: 4,
    y: 5
}, "same point" = Point {
    x: 4,
    y: 5
}
```

The ways of using the macro as illustrated in later (not the first) examples
will mostly benefit existing Rust programmers.

### Move semantics

It is important to note here that since the type `Point` is not `Copy`, it has
move semantics. Since `dbg!(p)` would involve moving `p`, using `dbg!(p, p);`
would involve moving the value twice, which Rust will not allow. Therefore,
a borrow to `p` is used in `dbg!("first point" => &p, "second point" => &p);`.

### Compact mode:

Those developers who feel the source location header is overly verbose may
choose to opt-out by setting the environment variable `RUST_DBG_COMPACT` to
`"1"`. This is a one-time setup cost the developer has to make for all current
and future Rust projects.

The effect of flipping this switch on is to print out the following instead
for the two last examples in [on-debug-builds]:

```
[src/main.rs:3] a = 1
[src/main.rs:4] a = 1, b = 2
[src/main.rs:5] a = 1, b = 2, a + b = 3
[src/main.rs:9] &p = Point { x: 4, y: 5}, &q = Point { x: 2, y: 1 }
```

and:

```
[src/main.rs:3] "width" = 1, "height" = 2, "area" = 2
[src/main.rs:6] "first point" = Point { x: 4, y: 5 }, "same point" = Point { x: 4, y: 5 }
```

## Dealing with panics
[dealing with panics]: #dealing-with-panics

In the following example we have a panic in the second argument:

```rust
fn main() {
    let (a, b) = (1, 2);
    dbg!(a, panic!(), b);
}
```

running this program will print the following to `STDERR`:

```
[DEBUGGING, src/main.rs:2]
=> a = 1, panic!() = 
```

and to `STDOUT`:

```
thread 'main' panicked at 'explicit panic', src/main.rs:2:12
```

As can be seen from output, nothing is printed on RHS of `panic!()`. Why?
Because there's no value to present on RHS. Since a panic may cause necessary
side effects for subsequent arguments in `dbg!(..)` to not happen, the macro is
fail-fast on any panic in order to avoid cascading panics and unsafety.

## On release builds

The same examples above will print nothing to `STDERR` and will instead simply
evaluate the expressions.

## Calling `dbg!()` without any expressions

If you invoke the macro without providing any expressions as arguments, the
macro will treat this as if you passed the unit value `()` from which it
follow that the type will be the unit type.

Doing this can be useful if you want to ensure that a path is taken in
some conditional flow. An example:

```rust
fn main() {
    // assume we have: `some_important_conditional: bool` defined elsewhere.
    if some_important_conditional {
        dbg!();
    }
}
```

which may produce the following if `some_important_conditional` holds:

```
[DEBUGGING, src\lib.rs:4]
=> () = ()
```

## Types which are not `Debug`

**This feature will be available once [`specialization`] has been stabilized
and not before.**

If you are writing generic code and want to debug the value of some expression
`expr: T` where `T: Debug` might hold, but you don't want to add this to the
bound, you may simply use `dbg!(expr)`. This may be useful when you are deep
within some generic algorithm and the hassle of moving up the call stack is
in the way of productivity. Instead, if `T: Debug` holds implicitly, then the
debug impl will be used, otherwise we try to give as much helpful information
as we can.

This is solved via [`specialization`]. The expression is first wrapped in a
struct which has a `Debug` impl for all types which gives information about the
type of the expression. For types which are `Debug`, the `Debug` impl of the
struct is specialized to use the `Debug` implementation of the wrapped type.

With the following example:

```rust
fn main() {
    struct X(usize);
    let a = X(1);
    dbg!(&a);
}
```

the following is printed to `STDERR`:

```
[DEBUGGING, src/main.rs:3]
=> &a = [<unknown> of type &main::X is !Debug]
```

This tells you the type of `&a`, and that it is not `Debug`.

## An example from the real world

You have been given a task to implement `n!`, the factorial function - a common
task for those learning programming, which you have decided to implement using a
simple recursive solution looking like this:

```rust
fn factorial(n: u32) -> u32 {
    if n <= 1 {
        1
    } else {
        n * factorial(n - 1)
    }
}

fn main() {
    factorial(4);
}
```

Now, you, as a learner, want to see how the recursion expands, and use the
`dbg!` macro to your aid:

```rust
fn factorial(n: u32) -> u32 {
    if dbg!(n <= 1) {
        dbg!(1)
    } else {
        dbg!(n * factorial(n - 1))
    }
}

fn main() {
    dbg!(factorial(4));
}
```

You run the program, and get back a print out which clearly shows the function
recursively descending into a stack, before ascending and building the final
value, and then it shows the final answer again.

```
[DEBUGGING, src/main.rs:1]
=> n <= 1 = false

[DEBUGGING, src/main.rs:1]
=> n <= 1 = false

[DEBUGGING, src/main.rs:1]
=> n <= 1 = false

[DEBUGGING, src/main.rs:1]
=> n <= 1 = true

[DEBUGGING, src/main.rs:2]
=> 1 = 1

[DEBUGGING, src/main.rs:4]
=> n * factorial(n - 1) = 2

[DEBUGGING, src/main.rs:4]
=> n * factorial(n - 1) = 6

[DEBUGGING, src/main.rs:4]
=> n * factorial(n - 1) = 24

[DEBUGGING, src/main.rs:9]
=> factorial(4) = 24
```

or prints, with `RUST_DBG_COMPACT = 1`:

```
[src/main.rs:1] n <= 1 = false
[src/main.rs:1] n <= 1 = false
[src/main.rs:1] n <= 1 = false
[src/main.rs:1] n <= 1 = true
[src/main.rs:2] 1 = 1
[src/main.rs:4] n * factorial(n - 1) = 2
[src/main.rs:4] n * factorial(n - 1) = 6
[src/main.rs:4] n * factorial(n - 1) = 24
[src/main.rs:9] factorial(4) = 24
```

But you prefer labels, since you think they are more informative,
and use them instead:

```rust
fn factorial(n: u32) -> u32 {
    if dbg!("are we at the base case?" => n <= 1) {
        dbg!("base value" => 1)
    } else {
        dbg!("ascending with n * factorial(n - 1)" => n * factorial(n - 1))
    }
}
```

which prints:

```
[DEBUGGING, src/main.rs:1]
=> "are we at the base case?" = false

[DEBUGGING, src/main.rs:1]
=> "are we at the base case?" = false

[DEBUGGING, src/main.rs:1]
=> "are we at the base case?" = false

[DEBUGGING, src/main.rs:1]
=> "are we at the base case?" = true

[DEBUGGING, src/main.rs:2]
=> "base value" = 1

[DEBUGGING, src/main.rs:4]
=> "ascending with n * factorial(n - 1)" = 2

[DEBUGGING, src/main.rs:4]
=> "ascending with n * factorial(n - 1)" = 6

[DEBUGGING, src/main.rs:4]
=> "ascending with n * factorial(n - 1)" = 24

[DEBUGGING, src/main.rs:9]
=> factorial(4) = 24
```

or prints, with `RUST_DBG_COMPACT = 1`:

```
[src/main.rs:1] "are we at the base case?" = false
[src/main.rs:1] "are we at the base case?" = false
[src/main.rs:1] "are we at the base case?" = false
[src/main.rs:1] "are we at the base case?" = true
[src/main.rs:2] "base value" = 1
[src/main.rs:4] "ascending with n * factorial(n - 1)" = 2
[src/main.rs:4] "ascending with n * factorial(n - 1)" = 6
[src/main.rs:4] "ascending with n * factorial(n - 1)" = 24
[src/main.rs:9] factorial(4) = 24
```

Finally, you'd also like to see the value of `n` at each recursion step. Using
the multiple-arguments feature, you write, with very little effort, and run:

```rust
fn factorial(n: u32) -> u32 {
    if dbg!(n, (n <= 1)).1 {
        dbg!(n, 1).1
    } else {
        dbg!(n, n * factorial(n - 1)).1
    }
}
```

which outputs:

```
[DEBUGGING, src/main.rs:1]
=> n = 4, (n <= 1) = false

[DEBUGGING, src/main.rs:1]
=> n = 3, (n <= 1) = false

[DEBUGGING, src/main.rs:1]
=> n = 2, (n <= 1) = false

[DEBUGGING, src/main.rs:1]
=> n = 1, (n <= 1) = true

[DEBUGGING, src/main.rs:2]
=> n = 1, 1 = 1

[DEBUGGING, src/main.rs:4]
=> n = 2, n * factorial(n - 1) = 2

[DEBUGGING, src/main.rs:4]
=> n = 3, n * factorial(n - 1) = 6

[DEBUGGING, src/main.rs:4]
=> n = 4, n * factorial(n - 1) = 24

[DEBUGGING, src/main.rs:9]
=> factorial(4) = 24
```

or prints, with `RUST_DBG_COMPACT = 1`:

```
[src/main.rs:1] n = 4, (n <= 1) = false
[src/main.rs:1] n = 3, (n <= 1) = false
[src/main.rs:1] n = 2, (n <= 1) = false
[src/main.rs:1] n = 1, (n <= 1) = true
[src/main.rs:2] n = 1, 1 = 1
[src/main.rs:4] n = 2, n * factorial(n - 1) = 2
[src/main.rs:4] n = 3, n * factorial(n - 1) = 6
[src/main.rs:4] n = 4, n * factorial(n - 1) = 24
[src/main.rs:9] factorial(4) = 24
```

# Reference-level explanation
[reference-level-explanation]: #reference-level-explanation

**NOTE:** The exact output format is not meant to be stabilized even when/if the
macro is stabilized.

The macro is called `dbg` and accepts either a comma-separated or
comma-terminated list of `expr`, or a list of `label => expr` which
is also separated or terminated with commas.

The terminated versions are defined as:

1. `($($val: expr),+,) => { dbg!( $($val),+ ) };`
2. `($($lab: expr => $val: expr),+,) => { dbg!( $($lab => $val),+ ) };`

The separated versions accept the following:

1. `($($val: expr),+)`
2. `($($lab: expr => $val: expr),+)`

Finally, the macro can be called as `dbg!()`.

The macro only prints something if `cfg!(debug_assertions)` holds, meaning that
if the program is built as a release build, nothing will be printed, and the
result of using the macro on an expressions or expressions is simply the
expression itself or a flat tuple of the expressions themselves. In effect the
result is applying the identity function on the expression(s), but the call will
be inlined away such that the overhead is zero.

## The type of `dbg!(expressions)`

"Applying" `dbg` on a list of expressions
`[expr1, expr2 [, .., exprN]` gives back an expression of the following type
and value:

+ List of size 0, `dbg!()`: The type is the unit type `()`.

+ List of size 1, `dbg!(expr)`: The type is the type of `expr` and the value is
the value of `expr`.

+ Otherwise, `dbg!(expr1, expr2 [, expr3, .., exprN])`: The type is the type
of the tuple `(expr1, expr2 [, expr3, .., exprN])` which is the value.

## Schematic/step-wise explanation (for debug builds)

1. The standard error is locked and wrapped in a buffered writer called `err`.

2. Assume `let p = option_env!("RUST_DBG_COMPACT").map_or(true, |s| s == "0");`.

If `p` holds, the file name (given by `file!()`) and line number (`line!()`) is
included in the print out for increased utility when the macro is used in
non-trivial code. This is wrapped by `[DEBUGGING, <location>]\n=> ` as in:

```rust
write!(&mut err, "[DEBUGGING, {}:{}]\n=> ", file!(), line!())
```

If `p` does not hold, this instead prints:

```rust
write!(&mut err, "[{}:{}] ", file!(), line!())
```

3. + For `()`

Defined as `dbg!(())`.

3. + For `($($val: expr),+)`

For each `$val` (the expression), the following is printed, comma separated:
The value of the expression is presented on the right hand side (RHS) of an
equality sign `=` while the result of `stringify!(expr)` is presented on the
left hand side (LHS). This is done so that the developer easily can see the
syntactic structure of the expression that evaluted to RHS.

In other words, the following:
`write!(&mut err, "{} = {:#?}", stringify!($lab), tmp);` is done.
If `p` holds, `{:?}` is used as the format instead of `{:#?}`.

3. + For `($($lab: expr => $val: expr),+)`:

For each `$lab => $val` (the label and expression), the following is printed,
comma separated: The value of the expression is presented on RHS of an equality
sign `=` while the label is presented on LHS.

In other words, the following:
`write!(&mut err, "{} = {:#?}", stringify!($lab), tmp);` is done.
If `p` holds, `{:?}` is used as the format instead of `{:#?}`.
The label is also verified to be a string slice literal.

4. Finally, a newline is printed, or two newlines in the case `p` holds.

In both 3. and 4. if RHS should panic, then LHS = shall at least be printed.

## Example implementation

The `dbg!` macro is semantically (with the notable detail that the helper macros
and any non-`pub` `fn`s must be inlined in the actual implementation):

```rust
pub fn in_detailed_mode() -> bool {
    option_env!("RUST_DBG_COMPACT").map_or(false, |s| s == "0")
}

macro_rules! verify_str_lit {
    ($($expr: expr),*) => {
        $({
            let _ = concat!($expr, "");
            let _ : &'static str = $expr;
        })*
    };
}

macro_rules! w {
    ($err: ident, $($t: tt)+) => { write!(&mut $err, $($t)+).unwrap(); }
}

macro_rules! dbg_header {
    ($err: ident) => {
        if in_detailed_mode() {
            w!($err, "[DEBUGGING, {}:{}]\n=> ", file!(), line!())
        } else {
            w!($err, "[{}:{}] ", file!(), line!())
        }
    };
}

macro_rules! dbg_footer {
    ($err: ident) => {
        if in_detailed_mode() { w!($err, "\n\n") } else { w!($err, "\n") }
    };
}

macro_rules! dbg_expr {
    ($err: ident, $lab: expr => $val: expr) => {{
        w!($err, "{} = ", $lab);
        let _tmp = $val;
        if in_detailed_mode() { w!($err, "{:#?}", _tmp) }
        else { w!($err, "{:?}" , _tmp) }
        _tmp
    }}
}

macro_rules! dbg_core {
    ($labf: expr => $valf: expr $(, $lab: expr => $val: expr)*) => {{
        #[allow(unreachable_code, unused_must_use, unused_parens)]
        let _r = {
        #[cfg(not(debug_assertions))] { ($valf $(, $val)*) }
        #[cfg(debug_assertions)] {
            use ::std::io::Write;
            let stderr = ::std::io::stderr();
            let mut err = ::std::io::BufWriter::new(stderr.lock());

            dbg_header!(err);
            let ret = (
                dbg_expr!(err, $labf => $valf)
                $(, {
                    w!(err, ", ");
                    dbg_expr!(err, $lab => $val)
                } )*
            );
            dbg_footer!(err);
            ret
        }
        };
        _r
    }};
}

#[macro_export]
macro_rules! dbg {
    // Handle `dbg!()` <-- literal
    () => {
        dbg!( () );
    };
    // Handle trailing comma:
    ($($val: expr),+,) => {
        dbg!( $($val),+ )
    };
    ($($lab: expr => $val: expr),+,) => {
        dbg!( $($lab => $val),+ )
    };
    // Without label, use source of $val:
    ($valf: expr $(, $val: expr)*) => {
        dbg_core!($valf => $valf $(, $val => $val)*)
    };
    // With label:
    ($labf: expr => $valf: expr $(, $lab: expr => $val: expr)*) => {{
        verify_str_lit!($labf $(, $lab)*);
        dbg_core!($labf => $valf $(, $lab => $val)*)
    }};
}
```

## Exact implementation

The exact implementation, which is authoritative on the semantics of this RFC,
is given by:

```rust
#[macro_export]
macro_rules! dbg {
    // Handle `dbg!()` <-- literal
    () => {
        dbg!( () );
    };
    // Handle trailing comma:
    ($($val: expr),+,) => {
        dbg!( $($val),+ )
    };
    ($($lab: expr => $val: expr),+,) => {
        dbg!( $($lab => $val),+ )
    };

            _ret
        }
        };
        _r
    }};
}
```

On release builds, this macro reduces to:

```rust
#[macro_export]
macro_rules! dbg {
    // Handle `dbg!()` <-- literal
    () => {
        dbg!( () );
    };
    // Handle trailing comma:
    ($($val: expr),+,) => {
        dbg!( $($val),+ )
    };
    ($($lab: expr => $val: expr),+,) => {
        dbg!( $($lab => $val),+ )
    };
    // Without label, use source of $val:
    ($valf: expr $(, $val: expr)*) => {{
        // in order: for panics, clarification on: dbg!(expr);, dbg!(expr)
        #[allow(unreachable_code, unused_must_use, unused_parens)]
        let _r = {{ ($valf $(, $val)*) }};
        _r
    }};
    // With label:
    ($labf: expr => $valf: expr $(, $lab: expr => $val: expr)*) => {{
        // in order: for panics, clarification on: dbg!(expr);, dbg!(expr)
        #[allow(unreachable_code, unused_must_use, unused_parens)]
        let _r = {{ ($valf $(, $val)*) }};
        _r
    }};
}
```

which further reduces to the following, which clearly shows that the invocation
is nothing more than the identity on the tuple passed:

```rust
#[macro_export]
macro_rules! dbg {
    () => { dbg!( () ); };
    ($($val: expr),+,) => { dbg!( $($val),+ ) };
    ($($lab: expr => $val: expr),+,) => { dbg!( $($lab => $val),+ ) };
    ($(              $val: expr),+) => {{ ( $($val),* ) }};
    ($($lab: expr => $val: expr),+) => {{ ( $($val),* ) }};
}
```

## Specialization and non-`Debug` types.

**This feature will be available once [`specialization`] has been stabilized
and not before.** Once that happens, the feature will simply be added to the
macro without going through another RFC process.

The following is added inside the macro:

```rust
// All of this is internal to the macro and not exported:

struct WrapDebug<T>(T);

use std::fmt::{Debug, Formatter, Result};

impl<T> Debug for WrapDebug<T> {
    default fn fmt(&self, f: &mut Formatter) -> Result {
        use std::intrinsics::type_name;
        write!(f, "[<unknown> of type {} is !Debug]",
            unsafe { type_name::<T>() })
    }
}

impl<T: Debug> Debug for WrapDebug<T> {
    fn fmt(&self, f: &mut Formatter) -> Result { self.0.fmt(f) }
}
```

This mechanism is inspired by version 0.1.2 of [`debugit`].

Changes in the exact implementation:

The lines with `let _tmp = $valf;` and `let _tmp = $val;` are replaced with
`let _tmp = WrapDebug($valf);` and `let _tmp = WrapDebug($val);`. The lines
with `_tmp` are replaced with `_tmp.0`.

# Drawbacks
[drawbacks]: #drawbacks

It could be considered bloat, and `println!("{:#?}", expr)` might be
sufficiently ergonomic for both experienced rustaceans and newcomers.

# Rationale and alternatives
[alternatives]: #alternatives

The formatting is informative, but could be formatted in other ways depending
on what is valued. A more terse format could be used if `stringify!` or
`file!()`, line and column numbers is not deemed beneficial, which this RFC
argues it should. The RFC argues that the possibility of opting out to this
header via an env var strikes a good balance.

For more alternatives, questions and how they were resolved,
see [formerly unresolved] for a more detailed Q & A.

The impact of not merging the RFC is that the papercut, if considered as such,
remains.

## Bikeshed: The name of the macro

Several names has been proposed for the macro. Some of the candidates were:

+ `debug!`, which was the original name. This was however already used by the
`log` crate.
+ `d!`, which was deemded to be too short to be informative and convey intent.
+ `dump!`, which was confused with stack traces.
+ `show!`, inspired by Haskell. `show` was deemed less obvious than `dbg!`.
+ `peek!`, which was also deemed less obvious.
+ `DEBUG!`, which was deemed too screamy.
+ `qdbg!`, which was deemed to hurt searchability and learnability since it
isn't prefixed with `d`(ebug).

While it is unfortunate that `debug!` was unavailable, `dbg!` was deemed the
next best thing, which is why it was picked as the name of the macro.

## How do we teach this?

Part of the [motivation][for-aspiring-rustaceans] for this macro was to delay
the point at which aspiring rustaceans have to learn how formatting arguments
work in the language. For this to be effective, the macro should be taught prior
to teaching formatting arguments, but after teaching the user to write their
first "hello world" and other uses of `println!("<string literal>")` which does
not involve formatting arguments, which should first be taught when formatting
is actually interesting, and not as a part of printing out the value of an
expression.

## Formerly unresolved questions
[formerly unresolved]: #formerly-unresolved-questions

The following section gives a overview of certain design decisions taken during
the RFC process and a detailed reasoning behind the decisions. These questions
are ordered by when they were introduced.

### 1. Should the `file!()` be included?

**Yes**, since it would be otherwise difficult to tell where the output is coming
from in a larger project with multiple files. It is not very useful on
the [playground](https://play.rust-lang.org), but that exception is acceptable.

### 2. Should the line number be included?

**Yes**, for a large file, it would also be difficult to locate the source of the
output otherwise.

### 3. Should the column number be included?

**No.** It is more likely than not that no more than one `dbg!(...)` will occur.
If it does, it will most likely be when dealing with binary operators such as
with: `dbg!(x) + dbg!(y) + dbg!(z)`, or with several arguments to a
function / method call. However, since the macro prints out `stringify!(expr)`,
which in the case of the additions would result in:
`x = <val>, y = <val>, z = <val>`, the user can clearly see which expression on
the line that generated the value. The only exception to this is if the same
expression is used multiple times and crucically has side effects altering the
value between calls. This scenario is probably very uncommon. Furthermore, even
in this case, one can distinguish between the calls since one is first and the
second comes next, visually.

However, the `column!()` isn't very visually disturbing since it uses horizontal
screen real-estate but not vertical real-estate, which may still be a good reason
to keep it. Nonetheless, this argument is not sufficient to keep `column!()`,
wherefore **this RFC will not include it**.

### 4. Should the `stringify!($val)` be included?

**Yes**, it helps the user see the source of the value printed.

### 5. Should the macro be pass-through with respect to the expression?

In other words: should the value of applying the macro to the expression be the
value of the expression?

**Yes**, the pass-through mechanism allows the macro to be less intrusive as
discussed in the [motivation].

### 6. Should the macro act as the identity function on release modes?

If the answer to this is yes, 5. must also be yes, i.e: 6. => 5.

**Yes**, since some users who develop programs, and not libraries, can leave
such `dbg!(..)` invocations in and push it to source control since it won't
affect debug builds of the program.

[`specialization`]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1210
[`debugit`]: https://docs.rs/debugit/0.1.2/debugit/

### 7. Should the macro accept expressions where: `![typeof(expr) : Debug]`?

In other words, should expressions and values of non-`Debug` types be accepted
by the macro via [`specialization`] for `Debug` types?

**Yes**, and for two reasons:

+ Avoiding the bound `T: Debug` in generic code.

To see why, let's consider answering this question with a no. Imagine having
some generic algorithm in your code:

```rust
fn process_items<I>(iter: I) where I: Iterator {
    for elem in iter { /* .. */ }
}
```

Now you want inspect the value of `elem` is, so you use `dbg!(elem);`:

```rust
fn process_items<I>(iter: I) where I: Iterator {
    for elem in iter {
        dbg!(elt);
        // ..
    }
}
```

However, since doing `dbg!(elem)` requires that `I::Item : Debug`, you can't.
If you add the `Debug` bound, you'll also need to add it to any function, where
`Item` is held generic, which calls `process_items`, and transitively, you may
need add the bound to several function calls up the stack. Doing such a change
is not ergonomic as it may require you to even jump through different files.
With [`specialization`], you can instead use the `Debug` trait implicitly.

+ Some information is better than none.

Even if the type of `expr` does not satisfy the `Debug` bound, valuable
information can be displayed to the user. By using `std::intrinsics::type_name`
for non-`Debug` types, the user can at least know what the type of the
expression is, which is not nothing.

### 8. Should a trailing newline be added after each `dbg!(exprs...)`?

**Yes.** The result of answer in the negative would use the following format:

```
[DEBUGGING, src/main.rs:85]
=> a = 1
[DEBUGGING, src/main.rs:86]
=> a = 1, b = 2
[DEBUGGING, src/main.rs:87]
=> a = 1, b = 2, a + b = 3
```

instead of:

```
[DEBUGGING, src/main.rs:85]
=> a = 1

[DEBUGGING, src/main.rs:86]
=> a = 1, b = 2

[DEBUGGING, src/main.rs:87]
=> a = 1, b = 2, a + b = 3
```

The latter format, to many readers, look considerably more readable thanks to
visual association of a particular set of values with the `DEBUGGING` header and
make the users own `println!(..)` and `eprintln!(..)` calls stand out more due
to the absence of the header.

A counter argument to this is that users with IDEs or vertically short terminals
may have as little as `25%` of vertical screen space allocated for the program's
output with the rest belonging to the actual code editor. To these users, lines
are too precious to waste in this manner since scrolling may require the use of
the mouse or switching of keyboard input focus.

However, it is more unlikely that a user will see the information they are
looking for in a small window without scrolling. Here, searchability is aided by
grouping which is visually pleasing to process.

This was resolved by having the env var `RUST_DBG_COMPACT = 1` format the above
example as:

```
[src/main.rs:85] a = 1
[src/main.rs:86] a = 1, b = 2
[src/main.rs:87] a = 1, b = 2, a + b = 3
```

### 9. Should literals used in `dbg!(lit);` print out `lit` instead of `lit = lit`?

**No**. The left hand side of the equality adds no new information wherefore it
might be a redundant annoyance. On the other hand, it may give a sense of
symmetry with the non-literal forms such as `a = 42`. Keeping `5 = 5` is also
more consistent, wherefore that format will be used. 

### 10. Should `dbg!(expr);` generate an "unused" warning?

**No**. In the case of:

```rust
fn main() {
    let a = 42;
    dbg!(a);
}
```

the macro is used in "print" mode instead of "passhrough inspector" mode.
Both are expected and supported ways of using this macro wherefore no warning
should be raised.

### 11. Should `STDOUT` be used over `STDERR` as the output stream?

**No.** The messages printed using `dbg!(..)` are not usually errors, which is
one reason to use `STDOUT` instead. However, `STDERR` is often used as a second
channel for extra messages. This use of `STDERR` often occurs when `STDOUT`
carries some data which you can't mix with random messages.

If we consider a program such as `ripgrep`, where should hypothetical uses of
`dbg!(..)` print to in the case of `rg some_word < input_file > matching_lines`?
Should they end up on the terminal or in the file `matching_lines`? Clearly
the former is correct in this case.

One could say that this design is a lousy choice by the programmer and that
debug messages should be logged to a file, but this macro must cater to "lousy"
programmers who just want to debug quickly.

For these reasons, `STDERR` should be used.

### 12. Should `std::panic::catch_unwind` be used to handle panics?

**No.** If `expr` in `dbg!("label" => expr)` panics, should something be printed
on the RHS of `"label" => ` as in: `"label" => <panic>` ? If so, should all
panics be caught such that:

```rust
fn main() {
    let (a, b) = (1, 2);
    dbg!(a, panic!(), b);
}
```

prints (using `RUST_DBG_COMPACT = 1`) to `STDERR`:

```rust
[src/main.rs:2] a = 1, panic!() = <panic>, b = 2
```

and to `STDOUT`:

```
thread 'main' panicked at 'explicit panic', src/main.rs:2:12
```

and a single panic "re-thrown" after everything has been printed?

This is a bad idea for two reasons:

1. If `foo()` panics in `(foo(), bar())`, then `bar()` is not evaluated. The
user should be able to expect similar semantics from `dbg!(foo(), bar())` to
`(foo(), bar())`.

2. Given `(foo(), bar())`, a panic in `foo()` entails that the postconditions of
`foo()` aren't guaranteed. If `bar()` relies on these postconditions of `foo()`
in its preconditions, then since the postconditions do not always hold, `bar()`
must not be evaluated.

Now that the second question has been resolved in the negative, we can resolve
the first one. Since `"label" => ` combined with a message in `STDOUT` as seen
in [dealing with panics] is sufficiently clear, the overhead of `catch_unwind`
is for very little gain, wherefore this question is too answered in the negative.
