# Summary
[summary]: #summary

- Stabilize `core::marker::Freeze` in trait bounds.
	- Rename `core::marker::Freeze` to `core::marker::ShallowImmutable`. This proposition is tentative, the RFC will keep on using the historical `core::marker::Freeze` name.
	- Provide a marker type to opt out of `core::marker::Freeze` for the most semver-conscious maintainers. Tentatively named `core::marker::PhantomNotFreeze` (or `core::marker::PhantomNotShallowImmutable` to go with the proposed rename)

# Motivation
[motivation]: #motivation

With 1.78, Rust [changed behavior](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/121250): previously, `const REF: &T = &expr;` was (accidentally) accepted even when `expr` may contain interior mutability.
Now this requires that the type of `expr` satisfies `T: core::marker::Freeze`, which indicates that `T` doesn't contain any un-indirected `UnsafeCell`, meaning that `T`'s memory cannot be modified through a shared reference.

The purpose of this change was to ensure that interior mutability cannot affect content that may have been static-promoted in read-only memory, which would be a soundness issue.
However, this new requirement also prevents using static-promotion to create constant references to data of generic type. This pattern can be used to approximate "generic `static`s" (with the distinction that static-promotion doesn't guarantee a unique address for the promoted content). An example of this pattern can be found in `stabby` and `equator`'s shared way of constructing v-tables:
```rust
pub trait VTable<'a>: Copy {
    const VT: &'a Self;
}
pub struct VtAccumulator<Tail, Head> {
    tail: Tail,
    head: Head,
}
impl<Tail: VTable<'a>, Head: VTable<'a>> VTable<'a> for VtAccumulator<Tail, Head> {
	const VT: &'a Self = &Self {tail: *Tail::VT, head: *Head::VT}; // Doesn't compile since 1.78
} 
```

Making `VTable` a subtrait of `core::marker::Freeze` in this example is sufficient to allow this example to compile again, as static-promotion becomes legal again. This is however impossible as of today due to `core::marker::Freeze` being restricted to `nightly`.

Orthogonally to static-promotion, `core::marker::Freeze` can also be used to ensure that transmuting `&T` to a reference to an interior-immutable type (such as `[u8; core::mem::size_of::<T>()]`) is sound (as interior-mutation of a `&T` may lead to UB in code using the transmuted reference, as it expects that reference's pointee to never change). This is notably a safety requirement for `zerocopy` and `bytemuck` which are currently evaluating the use of `core::marker::Freeze` to ensure that requirement; or rolling out their own equivalents (such as zerocopy's `Immutable`) which imposes great maintenance pressure on these crates to ensure they support as many types as possible. They could stand to benefit from `core::marker::Freeze`'s status as an auto-trait, and `zerocopy` intends to replace its bespoke trait with a re-export of `core::marker::Freeze`.

Note that for this latter use-case, `core::marker::Freeze` isn't entirely sufficient, as an additional proof that `T` doesn't contain padding bytes is necessary to allow this transmutation to be safe, as reading one of `T`'s padding bytes as a `u8` would be UB.

Renaming the trait to `core::marker::ShallowImmutable` is desirable because `freeze` is already a term used in `llvm` to refer to an intrinsic which allows to safely read from uninitialized memory. [Another RFC](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/3605) is currently open to expose this intrinsic in Rust.

# Guide-level explanation
[guide-level-explanation]: #guide-level-explanation

`core::marker::Freeze` is a trait that is implemented for any type whose memory layout doesn't contain any `UnsafeCell`: it indicates that the memory referenced by `&T` is guaranteed not to change while the reference is live.

It is automatically implemented by the compiler for any type that doesn't contain an un-indirected `core::cell::UnsafeCell`.

Notably, a `const` can only store a reference to a value of type `T` if `T: core::marker::Freeze`, in a pattern named "static-promotion".

As `core::marker::Freeze` is an auto-trait, it poses an inherent semver-hazard (which is already exposed through static-promotion): this RFC proposes the simultaneous addition and stabilization of a `core::marker::PhantomNotFreeze` type to provide a stable mean for maintainers to reliably opt out of `Freeze` without forbidding zero-sized types that are currently `!Freeze` due to the conservativeness of `Freeze`'s implementation being locked into remaining `!Freeze`.

# Reference-level explanation
[reference-level-explanation]: #reference-level-explanation

## `core::marker::Freeze`

The following documentation is lifted from the current nightly documentation.
```markdown
Used to determine whether a type contains
any `UnsafeCell` internally, but not through an indirection.
This affects, for example, whether a `static` of that type is
placed in read-only static memory or writable static memory.
This can be used to declare that a constant with a generic type
will not contain interior mutability, and subsequently allow
placing the constant behind references.
# Safety
This trait is a core part of the language, it is just expressed as a trait in libcore for
convenience. Do *not* implement it for other types.
```

From a cursory review, the following documentation improvements may be considered:

```markdown
[`Freeze`] marks all types that do not contain any un-indirected interior mutability.
This means that their byte representation cannot change as long as a reference to them exists.

Note that `T: Freeze` is a shallow property: `T` is still allowed to contain interior mutability,
provided that it is behind an indirection (such as `Box<UnsafeCell<U>>`).
Notable `!Freeze` types are [`UnsafeCell`](core::cell::UnsafeCell) and its safe wrappers
such as the types in the [`cell` module](core::cell), [`Mutex`](std::sync::Mutex), and [atomics](core::sync::atomic).
Any type which contains a non-`Freeze` type without indirection also does not implement `Freeze`.

`T: Freeze` is notably a requirement for static promotion (`const REF: &'a T;`) to be legal.

Note that static promotion doesn't guarantee a single address: if `REF` is assigned to multiple variables,
they may still refer to distinct addresses.

Whether or not `T` implements `Freeze` may also affect whether `static STATIC: T` is placed
in read-only static memory or writeable static memory, or the optimizations that may be performed
in code that holds an immutable reference to `T`.

# Semver hazard
`Freeze` being an auto-trait, it may leak private properties of your types to semver.
Specifically, adding a non-`Freeze` field to a type's layout is a _major_ breaking change,
as it removes a trait implementation from it. Removing the last non-`Freeeze` field of a type's
layout is a _minor_ breaking change, as it adds a trait implementation to that type.

## The ZST caveat
While `UnsafeCell<T>` is currently `!Freeze` regardless of `T`, allowing `UnsafeCell<T>: Freeze` iff `T` is
a Zero-Sized-Type is currently under consideration.

Therefore, the advised way to make your types `!Freeze` regardless of their actual contents is to add a 
[`PhantomNotFreeze`](core::marker::PhantomNotFreeze) field to it.

# Safety
This trait is a core part of the language, it is just expressed as a trait in libcore for
convenience. Do *not* implement it for other types.
```

Mention could be added to `UnsafeCell` and atomics that adding one to a previously `Freeze` type without an indirection (such as a `Box`) is a SemVer hazard, as it will revoke its implementation of `Freeze`.

## `core::marker::PhantomNotFreeze`

This ZST is proposed as a means for maintainers to reliably opt out of `Freeze` without constraining currently `!Freeze` ZSTs to remain so. While the RFC author doesn't have the expertise to produce its code,
here's its propsed documentation:

```markdown
[`PhantomNotFreeze`] is type with the following guarantees:
- It is guaranteed not to affect the layout of a type containing it as a field.
- Any type including it in its fields (including nested fields) without indirection is guaranteed to be `!Freeze`.

This latter property is [`PhantomNotFreeze`]'s raison-d'Ãªtre: while other Zero-Sized-Types may currently be `!Freeze`,
[`PhantomNotFreeze`] is the only ZST that's guaranteed to keep that bound.

Notable types that are currently `!Freeze` but might not remain so in the future are:
- `UnsafeCell<T>` where `core::mem::size_of::<T>() == 0` 
- `[T; 0]` where `T: !Freeze`.

Note that `core::marker::PhantomData<T>` is `Freeze` regardless of `T`'s `Freeze`ness.
```

The note on `PhantomData` is part of the RFC to reflect the current status, which cannot be changed without causing breakage.

# Drawbacks
[drawbacks]: #drawbacks

- Some people have previously argued that this would be akin to exposing compiler internals.
	- The RFC author disagrees, viewing `Freeze` in a similar light as `Send` and `Sync`: a trait that allows soundness requirements to be proven at compile time.
- `Freeze` being an auto-trait, it is, like `Send` and `Sync` a sneaky SemVer hazard.
	- Note that this SemVer hazard already exists through the existence of static-promotion, as exemplified by the following example:
	```rust
    // old version of the crate.
    mod v1 {
        pub struct S(i32);
        impl S {
            pub const fn new() -> Self { S(42) }
        }
    }

    // new version of the crate, adding interior mutability.
    mod v2 {
        use std::cell::Cell;
        pub struct S(Cell<i32>);
        impl S {
            pub const fn new() -> Self { S(Cell::new(42)) }
        }
    }

    // Old version: builds
    const C1: &v1::S = &v1::S::new();
    // New version: does not build
    const C2: &v2::S = &v2::S::new();
	```
 	- The provided example is also, in RFC author's estimation, the main way in which `Freeze` is likely to be depended upon: allowing bounds on it will likely not expand the hazard much.

# Rationale and alternatives
[rationale-and-alternatives]: #rationale-and-alternatives

- The benefits of stabilizing `core::mem::Freeze` have been highlighted in [Motivation](#motivation).
	- By not stabilizing `core::mem::Freeze` in trait bounds, we are preventing useful and sound code patterns from existing which were previously supported.
- Alternatively, a non-auto sub-trait of `core::mem::Freeze` may be defined:
	- While this reduces the SemVer hazard by making its breakage more obvious, this does lose part of the usefulness that `core::mem::Freeze` would provide to projects such as `zerocopy`.
	- A "perfect" derive macro should then be introduced to ease the implementation of this trait. A lint may be introduced in `clippy` to inform users of the existence and applicability of this new trait.

# Prior Art
[prior-art]: #prior-art
- This trait has a long history: it existed in ancient times but got [removed](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/13076) before Rust 1.0.
  In 2017 it got [added back](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/41349) as a way to simplify the implementation of the `interior_unsafe` query, but it was kept private to the standard library.
  In 2019, a [request](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/60715) was filed to publicly expose the trait, but not a lot happened until recently when the issue around static promotion led to it being [exposed unstably](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/121840).
- The work necessary for this RFC has already been done and merged in [this PR](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/121675), and a [tracking issue](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/121675) was opened.
- zerocopy's [`Immutable`](https://docs.rs/zerocopy/0.8.0-alpha.11/zerocopy/trait.Immutable.html) seeks to provide the same guarantees as `core::marker::Freeze`.

# Unresolved questions
[unresolved-questions]: #unresolved-questions

- [Should the trait be exposed under a different name?](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/121501#issuecomment-1962900148) to avoid collisions with `llvm`'s `freeze`? Here are the options cited during the design meeting:
	- `Freeze` has become part of the Rustacean jargon, should `llvm`'s `freeze` get a new name in the Rust jargon instead and this trait keep its current name?
 	- `ShallowImmutable`
  	- `LocalImmutable`
  	- `InlineImmutable`
  	- `ValueImmutable`
  	- `DirectImmutable`
  	- `InteriorImmutable`
- How concerned are we about `Freeze` as a semver hazard?
	- `Freeze` and `PhantomNotFreeze` could be stabilized at the same time.
 	- `PhantomNotFreeze` could be stabilized first, offering library authors a grace period to include it in their types before `Freeze` gets stabilized, adding new ways to depend on a type implementing it.
  	- Regardless, semver compliance guides and tools should be updated to ensure they handle it properly.
- What should be done about `PhantomData<T>` historically implementing `Freeze` regardless of whether or not `T` does?
	- We could simply ship `PhantomNotFreeze` (alternative names: `PhantomMutable`, `PhantomInteriorMutable`) as the RFC proposes.
 	- We could provide `PhantomFreezeIf<T>` which would be equivalent to `PhantomData<T>`, except it would only impl `Freeze` if `T` does.
  		- While slightly more complex than `PhantomNotFreeze` on the surface, this option does grant more flexibility. `type PhantomNotFreeze = PhantomFrezeIf<UnsafeCell<u8>>` could still be defined for convenience.
	- We could make `PhantomData` communicate `Freeze` the way it does `Send`, `Sync` and `Unpin`.
		- While this makes the behaviour more consistent, it may cause substantial breakage.
  		- If such an option was taken, crates that use `PhantomData<T>` to keep information about a type next to an indirected representation of it would need to be guided to modify it to `PhantomData<&'static T>`.
- Does `PhantomNotFreeze` have any operation semantics consequences? As in: is the exception of "mutation allowed behind shared references" tied to `UnsafeCell` or to the newly public trait?
	- If tied to `UnsafeCell`, the guarantee that any type containing `UnsafeCell` must never implement the trait should be ensured; this is the case as long as `unsafe impl Freeze` is disallowed.

# Future possibilities
[future-possibilities]: #future-possibilities

- One might later consider whether `core::mem::Freeze` should be allowed to be `unsafe impl`'d like `Send` and `Sync` are, possibly allowing wrappers around interiorly mutable data to hide this interior mutability from constructs that require `Freeze` if the logic surrounding it guarantees that the interior mutability will never be used.
	- The current status-quo is that it cannot be implemented manually (experimentally verified with 2024-05-12's nightly).
	- An `unsafe impl Freeze for T` would have very subtle soundness constraints: with such a declaration, performing mutation through any `&T` *or any pointer derived from it* would be UB. So this completely disables any interior mutability on fields of `T` with absolutely no way of ever recovering mutability.
	- Given these tight constraints, it is unclear what a concrete use-case for `unsafe impl Freeze` would be. So far, none has been found.
	- This consideration is purposedly left out of scope for this RFC to allow the stabilization of its core interest to go more smoothly; these two debates being completely orthogonal.
- Adding a `trait Pure: Freeze` which extends the interior immutability guarantee to indirected data could be valuable:
	- This is however likely to be a fool's errand, as indirections could (for example) be hidden behind keys to global collections. 
	- Providing such a trait could be left to the ecosystem unless we'd want it to be an auto-trait also (unlikely).
- `impl !Freeze for T` could be a nice alternative to `PhantomNotFreeze`. However, this would be a significant language change that needs much deeper consideration.
