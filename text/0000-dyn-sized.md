# Summary
[summary]: #summary

Add a (non-default-bound) marker trait `DynSized` and the corresponding lints to statically prevent
an `extern type` from being used where run-time size and alignment are needed.

# Motivation
[motivation]: #motivation

Foreign type (`extern type`, [RFC #1861]) is equivalent to C’s incomplete struct, often used to
create opaque pointers. These types have no known size and alignment, even at run-time. RFC #1861
noted that `size_of_val` and `align_of_val` should not be defined for `extern type`, but does not
specify how.

> … we must also be careful that `size_of_val` and `align_of_val` do not work either, as there is
> not necessarily a way at run-time to get the size of extern types either. For an initial
> implementation, those methods can just panic, but before this is stabilized there should be some
> trait bound or similar on them that prevents their use statically.

These functions are later implemented to return size of 0 and alignment of 1 as a stopgap solution
in [PR #44295].

`DynSized` was introduced as part of the competing [RFC #1993]. All types except opaque data types
implement `DynSized`, and thus can solve the `size_of_val` problem. Like `Sized`, it is an implied
bound that needs to be opt-out via `?DynSized`, and `T: ?Sized` will still imply `T: DynSized`.

The `DynSized` trait was implemented in [PR #46108]. However, making `DynSized` an implied bound
caused push back from the team. The `?Trait` feature was considered confusing, and causing pressure
and churn to package authors to generalization every `?Sized` to `?DynSized`. Further details can be
found in [RFC issue #2255].

This RFC attempts to find a solution which will

1. not cause breakage within the current epoch,
2. can statically detect misuse of `size_of_val`, and
3. does not require `?DynSized`.

# Guide-level explanation
[guide-level-explanation]: #guide-level-explanation

In Rust there are types which the compiler does not know the exact size. Slices `[T]` is one
example: the length of a slice is unknown when compiling. These types are known as
*dynamically sized types* (DSTs), as the exact size can only be known at run-time.

There are types which the size *cannot* be known even at run-time. They are mostly used when
interacting with external library, where objects are encapsulated behind opaque pointers. These are
called *foreign types* in Rust, and declared using the syntax `extern { type Foreign; }`.

Some Rust features expect types have a run-time size and thus cannot accept foreign types. An
obvious example is the `std::mem::size_of_val` function which computes the run-time size of a value.
Some less obvious examples are:

* Rust allows DSTs to be used as a struct field:

    ```rust ,ignore
    struct Data {
        checksum: u32,
        data: [u8], // <-- a DST
    }
    ```

    However, we need to know the alignment of the DST field to calculate its offset. A foreign type
    has no run-time alignment, and thus cannot be used inside a struct.

* Allocation of an object obviously requires its size and alignment. Moreover, deallocation also
    needs these information. This makes `Box<Foreign>` invalid.

To prevent us from accidentally allowing a foreign type in where run-time size is needed, the
standard library provides an additional marker trait `DynSized`, to indicate the type has a run-time
size. `DynSized` is automatically implemented for all types *except* foreign types.

We may bound a generic parameter by `DynSized` to totally exclude foreign types.

```rust ,ignore
unsafe fn as_byte_slice<T: DynSized + ?Sized>(val: &T) -> &[u8] {
//                         ^~~~~~~~ we require the type `T` to have run-time size.
    let size = size_of_val(val);
    let ptr = val as *const T as *const u8;
    unsafe { slice::from_raw_parts(ptr, size) }
}

let _ = as_byte_slice(&1);      // ok! sized types implement DynSized.

let _ = as_byte_slice("foo");   // ok! str also implement DynSized.

extern {
    type Foreign;
    fn get_foreign() -> *mut Foreign;
}

let _ = as_byte_slice(&*get_foreign());     // error! extern type does not implement DynSized.
```

Additionally, when we use types which possibly doesn’t have a run-time size in `size_of_val`, `Box`
or a struct field, there will be warnings:

```rust ,ignore
let _: Box<Foreign> = Box::from_raw(get_foreign());
//^ warning! cannot use extern type in a box.

struct Foo<T: ?Sized> {
    a: u8,
    b: T,   // warning! T might not have a run-time size
}
```

# Reference-level explanation
[reference-level-explanation]: #reference-level-explanation

## `DynSized` trait

Introduce a new marker trait `core::marker::DynSized`.

```rust ,ignore
#[unstable(feature = "dyn_sized", issue = "999999")]
#[lang = "dyn_sized"]
#[rustc_on_unimplemented = "`{Self}` does not have a size known at run-time"]
#[fundamental]
pub trait DynSized {}
```

Modify the `core::marker::Sized` marker trait to:

```rust ,ignore
#[stable(feature = "rust1", since = "1.0.0")]
#[lang = "sized"]
#[rustc_on_unimplemented = "`{Self}` does not have a constant size known at compile-time"]
#[fundamental]
pub trait Sized: DynSized {
    //           ^~~~~~~~ new
}
```

`DynSized` implementations are automatically generated by the compiler. Trying to implement
`DynSized` should emit an error, stating that `DynSized` is a special trait that is automatically
implemented ([E0322]).

`DynSized` will be implemented for the following types:

* `Sized` types i.e.
    * primitives `iN`, `uN`, `fN`, `char`, `bool`,
    * pointers `*const T`, `*mut T`,
    * references `&'a T`, `&'a mut T`,
    * function pointers `fn(T, U) -> V`,
    * arrays `[T; n]`,
    * never type `!`,
    * unit tuple `()`,
    * closures and generators
* slices `[T]`
* string slice `str`
* trait objects `dyn Trait`
* structs, tuples and enums where all fields are `DynSized`
* unions where at most one field is regular-sized*, and the rest are `Sized`

`DynSized` will *not* be implemented for the following types:

* foreign types
* structs, tuples and enums where at least one field is not `DynSized`
* unions where at least one field is not regular-sized*

`DynSized` is *not* a default bound. When `T: ?Sized`, we do not assume `T: DynSized`. Traits will
not have an implicit `DynSized` super-bound.

Note: “regular sized” is a subset of `DynSized` where the `size_of_val` is known via the type and
pointer metadata alone. All built-in `DynSized` types are regular sized, but when we support custom
DST there can be irregular sized types which are still `DynSized` e.g. a thin `CStr`. This RFC does
not attempt to specify the actual semantics of an unsized union beyond what is proposed in
[PR #47650]. We do not specify whether `union U([u8], [u16])` is `DynSized` or not. The decision
should be postponed until we actually want to support such unions.

## `#[assume_dyn_sized]` attribute

To uphold stability guarantee, we are not going to introduce `DynSized` bound to existing generic
bounds in the standard library.

Instead, we introduce a generic-parameter attribute `#[assume_dyn_sized]`:

```rust ,ignore
fn size_of_val<#[assume_dyn_sized] T: ?Sized>(val: &T) -> usize;
//             ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
```

`#[assume_dyn_sized] T: X` can be thought as `T: DynSized + X`, except that when we substitute a
non-`DynSized` type into `T`, it simply triggers a warning instead of an error.
`#[assume_dyn_sized]` should not affect inference result.

The `#[assume_dyn_sized]` attribute is considered an implementation detail and should not be
stabilized. Use of this attribute outside of the standard library is strongly discouraged, and the
proper bound `DynSized + ?Sized` should be used instead.

`#[assume_dyn_sized] T` does not really mean `T: DynSized`, e.g. the following should cause a
type-check error:

```rust ,ignore
fn foo<T: DynSized + ?Sized>() {
}
fn bar<#[assume_dyn_sized] T: ?Sized>() {
    foo::<T>(); // <-- error: T does not implement DynSized.
}
```

The `#[assume_dyn_sized]` attribute should be added to the following functions and types:

* `align_of_val`, `size_of_val`
* `RefCell`
* `Rc`, `Weak`
* `Arc`, `Weak`
* `Box`
* `Mutex`
* `RwLock`

In rustdoc, render use of this attribute `#[assume_dyn_sized] T: X` as `T: DynSized + X`.

## Lints

It is an error to use to non-`DynSized` types as a struct field or in `size_of_val`/`align_of_val`.
To avoid introducing breaking changes, we are going to close this gap across 3 milestones (one
milestone is one epoch or smaller time units).

### Milestone 0: Warning period

* Move into this milestone after `DynSized` is implemented (but is unstable). Do not stabilize
    `extern type` before this milestone is complete.

If a type cannot prove that it implements `DynSized`, but is used in places where `size_of_val`
etc are needed, a lint (`not_dyn_sized`, warn-by-default) will be issued. The places which triggers
the lint check are:

1. In a struct/tuple field, except the following conditions:

    * The field is the first and only field in the struct, or
    * The struct is `#[repr(packed)]`

2. In an enum variant (if we allow DST enum)
3. A type `T` substituted into a generic parameter which is annotated `#[assume_dyn_sized]`.

The type `T` passes the check when:

1. It can be proved to implement `DynSized`, or
2. It originates from a generic parameter annotated `#[assume_dyn_sized]`, or
3. It is a struct/tuple/enum where all fields satisfy one of these 3 conditions.

This lint **must never** be emitted in stable/beta channels in this milestone.

<details><summary>Examples</summary>

**Check 1:** A type which does not have guaranteed run-time size should not be allowed in a struct
field.

```rust ,ignore
struct Foo<T: ?Sized> {
    a: u8,
    b: T,
}
```

```
warning: type `T` is not guaranteed to have a known size and alignment, and may cause panic at run-time
 --> src/foo.rs:3:7
  |
1 | struct Foo<T: ?Sized> {
  |               ------ hint: change to `DynSized + ?Sized`
2 |     a: u8,
3 |     b: T,
  |        ^ alignment maybe undefined
  |
  = note: #[warn(not_dyn_sized)] on by default
  = note: this was previously accepted by the compiler but is being phased out; it will become a hard error in a future release!
```

**Check 2:** `#[assume_dyn_sized]` can be used to assume the type does have a run-time size. This
also puts a lint check on the input side.

```rust ,ignore
struct Bar<#[assume_dyn_sized] T: ?Sized> {
    a: u8,
    b: T,   // no lint here!
}
extern { type Opaque; }
let _: Bar<Opaque>; // lint here!
```

```
warning: type `Opaque` has no known size and alignment, and may cause panic at run-time
 --> src/bar.rs:6:11
  |
6 | let _: Bar<Opaque>; // lint here!
  |            ^^^^^^ size is undefined
  |
  = note: #[warn(not_dyn_sized)] on by default
  = note: this was previously accepted by the compiler but is being phased out; it will become a hard error in a future release!
```

**Check 3:** DynSized-ness can be checked in nested type.

```rust ,ignore
struct A<T: DynSized + ?Sized>(u8, (T,)); // no lint!
struct B<T: ?Sized>(u8, (T,)); // lint!
struct C<#[assume_dyn_sized] T: ?Sized>(u8, (T,)); // no lint!
```

</details>

### Milestone 1: Denial period

* Move into this milestone after the `DynSized` trait is stabilized.

Make `not_dyn_sized` deny-by-default, and enable the lint on stable/beta channel.

### Milestone 2: A new epoch

* Move into this milestone after a new epoch.

Turn the `not_dyn_sized` lint to a hard-error when the new epoch is selected.

### Milestone 3: Proper trait bounds

Replace all `#[assume_dyn_sized]` by proper `T: DynSized` bounds.

Since “breaking changes to the standard library are not possible” using epochs ([RFC #2052]), it may
be impossible to reach this milestone.

## Run-time behavior

Since violation of `#[assume_dyn_sized]` is just a lint, even if we misuse `size_of_val` the code
can still be successfully compiled, and we need to consider their behavior at run-time (i.e. after
monomorphization):

* When a struct/tuple field is a non-`DynSized` type, assume its alignment is 1. This ensures
    accessing a struct field `&foo.bar` will never panic.

* When `size_of_val`/`align_of_val` is instantiated with a non-`DynSized` type, generate a panic
    call. (An alternative is adapt the status-quo of returning 0 and 1 respectively.)

## Survey of existing DST usage

As a sanity check, we want to know how the community uses DST in order to know how the new lint will
affect them. We gather this information by categorizing DST usage of the “[top 100 packages] +
dependencies” (totally 191 packages) provided by Rust playground. We consider a piece of code is
“using DST” whenever `?Sized`, `size_of_val` or `align_of_val` appears.

From the list, many usage patterns are not affected by `DynSized`, since they often just needs to
give a pointer address to method.

* **Static trait object** —

    ```rust
    fn read_from<R: Read + ?Sized>(r: &mut R) -> Result<Self>;
    //              ^~~~              ^~~~~~
    ```

    A function takes an `&T` or `&mut T` reference, where the type `T` implements a trait. The
    `?Sized` bound allows the function to cover dynamic trait objects since `dyn Trait: Trait`. Its
    usage is typically limited to functions provided by the trait, and seldom needs to know the size
    or alignment.

    //              ^~~~~~~~~~~              ^~
    ```

    A function takes an `&T` reference, where `T` implements `AsRef<X>` meaning the `&T` can be
    converted to an `&X` without allocation. This is typically used to accept various kinds of
    strings which are unsized, thus the `?Sized` bound. The function usually immediately call
    `.as_ref()` to obtain the `&X`, and again seldom access the runtime size or alignment.

    //          ^~~~           ^~~~     ^~~~~~~~~
    ```

    A trait is reimplemented for smart pointers implementing the trait. The implementation typically
    just dereference the pointer and forward the method. Thus, the allocation aspect of the smart
    pointers are not touched.

    Delegation targets are seen in various forms:

    ```

    A trait is blanket-implemented for an existing trait. The `?Sized` is for completeness, and
    otherwise usually implemented like a typical trait which doesn’t need the size and alignment.

        size_of_val(&value),
    //  ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    );
    ```

    Most `size_of_val` calls are not used to obtain the runtime size of a DST, but to mimic C’s
    `sizeof` operator on a value, which are sized types. It is usually used in FFI scenario.

    //               ^~~~~~~~~~~~                       ^~
    ```

    A function takes an `&T` reference which implements `PartialEq<X>`, `PartialOrd<X>`,
    `Borrow<X>`, `Hash` or some similar methods that allows comparing the `&T` with an `&X`. This is
    typically used in data-structure types.

* Miscellaneous usages for `?Sized` bounds such as,
    * just want to use a `&T` without caring what `T` is (`error-chain`, `serde_json`, `tendril`)
    * use it for `Cow<T>` (`ansi_term`)
    * use it in associated type `type T: ?Sized` in order to be generic in accepting a string or
        byte slice (`ansi_term`, `regex`, `tendril`)

Now some usages which will be affected by `DynSized`.

* **Box** —

    ```rust
    struct P<T: ?Sized>(Box<T>);
    //                  ^~~~~~
    ```

    A type which contains a box of arbitrary unsized type. This is used in:

    * hyper (`PtrMapCell<V>`)
    * syntex_syntax (`P<T>`)
    * thread_local (`TableEntry<T>`)

* **DST struct** —

    ```rust
    struct Spawn<T: ?Sized> {
        id: usize,
        data: LocalMap,
        obj: T,
    //  ^~~~~~
    }
    ```

    This is used in:

    * futures (`Spawn<T>`)
    * tar (`Archive<R>`)

* **Unsafe memory copying** —

    ```rust
    let mut target = vec![0u8; size_of_val(&v)];
    //                         ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    ```

    Using `size_of_val` on a maybe-unsized type to `memcpy` the content somewhere else. This is used
    in:

    * nix (`copy_bytes`)

* **Transmuting** —

    Just tries to inspect the DST detail by transmutation or other unsafe tricks. This is used in:

    * traitobject

<!-- spell-checker:enable -->

Due to Rust’s stability guarantee, all above usage should continue to compile, even if it may panic
at runtime.

As we can see from the above statistics, in the 49 packages using DST features, only 12 packages
really assume `DynSized`, and out of which, 5 packages uses `Box<T>`/`Rc<T>`/`Arc<T>` simply for
delegation. This means it is more popular for `?Sized` to just mean “nothing is assumed”.

# Drawbacks
[drawbacks]: #drawbacks

Foreign type is a very exotic feature, but the `not_dyn_sized` lint applies to a much broader area.
Existing code seldom need to care about foreign types, and thus `DynSized` becomes an annoying
paper-cut for most users.

Even with this RFC, we still need to support `size_of_val`/`align_of_val` for non-`DynSized` input.
If we make `size_of_val` panic, dropping a `Box<Foreign>` will also panic which is undesirable. On
the other hand, if we make `size_of_val` return 0 or some made-up value, the allocator would free
the memory using the wrong size, which at best leaks the memory, and at worst overwrites unrelated
memory and causes undefined behavior.

# Rationale and alternatives
[alternatives]: #alternatives

## Rationales

* `DynSized` in this RFC is an empty marker trait. Previous RFCs suggest this trait to provide
    a `size_of_val`/`align_of_val` method which allows “custom DST”. We believe this is not the
    correct level to place such methods:

    1. These two methods need to be defined even for non-`DynSized` types. To the compiler, putting
        `size_of_val`/`align_of_val` inside `DynSized` is not generic enough. It should be defined
        on a global trait like `Any` minus the `'static` bound.

    2. Like `Sized`, we do not want users to implement `DynSized` themselves. Thus the customized
        of size and alignment should be implemented via a sub-trait of `DynSized`.

    In either case, `DynSized` should be empty even when we have custom DST.

* `DynSized` is automatically implemented by the compiler, but is not an auto trait. It can be made
    into an auto trait:

    ```rust ,ignore
    #[unstable(feature = "dyn_sized", issue = "999999")]
    #[lang = "dyn_sized"]
    #[rustc_on_unimplemented = "`{Self}` does not have a size known at run-time"]
    #[fundamental]
    pub auto trait DynSized {}
    ```

    Since `extern type` will not implement any auto traits, this line is enough to distinguish
    foreign types.

    Whether `DynSized` is an auto trait is an implementation detail, and this RFC does not dictate
    the choice. However, there may be compilation [performance problems] with auto traits.

## `DynSized` as implied bound

This RFC does not make `DynSized` an implied bound, in order to workaround [RFC issue #2255]. This
means existing `?Sized` bounds will continue to accept foreign types as input, and we cannot fix the
bounds of `size_of_val` without breaking backward compatibility. Instead we introduce a lint, and
make use of epochs to eventually turn the lint into an error. Still, the bounds of `size_of_val`
will forever be incorrect to support Epoch 2015.

An alternative is just accept that we want `?DynSized`. As stated in [RFC #1993], making `DynSized`
an implied bound has the following benefits:

* Libraries, including the standard library, can relax `?Sized` to `?DynSized` at their own pace
    without losing backward compatibility.
* The standard library can provide the correct bound for all types without the `#[assume_dyn_sized]`
    hack.
* `?Sized`/`?DynSized` looks better than `(DynSized + ?Sized)`/`?Sized`.

On the other hand, adding new implied bounds is currently blocked by the compiler [issue #21974].
Furthermore, concerns are raised about new implied bounds like `?DynSized` and `?Move`:

* Implied bound is a "negative feature", and it is confusing to reason about.
* Unlike the lints, the user needs to manually evaluate every use of `?Sized` and determine whether
    moving to `?DynSized` is acceptable.

## Replace `#[assume_dyn_sized]` by `DynSized` itself

Instead of introducing a new attribute for linting, we may make `DynSized` itself serve the purpose
for linting. We still restrict the bounds for `size_of_val` and friends:

```rust ,ignore
fn size_of_val<T: DynSized + ?Sized>(val: &T) -> usize;
//                ^~~~~~~~
```

However, when we instantiate `size_of_val::<Foreign>`, instead of a type-check error, we emit a lint
instead. This allows us to describe the parameter using the correct bound without breaking existing
code.

The drawback is that it makes the trait bound concept very unnatural — the `DynSized` bound is
written there, but it cannot be used for inference, and violating the bound just causes a warning
🤔.

## Post-monomorphization error

Instead of introducing `DynSized` or lints, we may simply refuse to compile during monomorphization
of `size_of_val`, `align_of_val` or struct field using a foreign type. This gives an accurate
compile-time error and only affects the rare cases where foreign type is actually misused.

Rust currently has no stable post-monomorphization lints or type errors, except recursion overflow.
All current post-monomorphization errors are related to unstable features e.g. using platform
intrinsics with wrong type ([E0511]) or invalid inline assembly. These errors are expected to be
checked in earlier phase before the features can be stabilized.

Introducing such errors marks a serious departure of this policy.

## Do nothing

Just make `size_of_val`/`align_of_val` panic or return some sensible value, and hope the user won’t
put a foreign type in them.
