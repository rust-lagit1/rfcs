# Summary
[summary]: #summary

Addition of hex literals in the form of `h"00 aa cc ff"`, which will be
transformed by compiler at compile time to `&'static [u8; N]`, in this case to
`&'static [0u8, 170u8, 204u8, 255u8]`.

# Motivation
[motivation]: #motivation

Hexadecimal representation is a very common for binary data. Currently Rust has
two ways to provide byte array constants:
- `b"foo"` notation, which is convenient if binary data is an ASCII string,
but becomes harder to use for general byte string with a lot of `\x` escaping.
- Explicit arrays: `[0x00, 0x01, ..]`. It takes three times more
space compared to a pure hex notation and thus harder to read and copy-paste
from external sources. Additionally its harder to group bytes, e.g. by groups
of 4 or 8.

By introducing hex literals we can improve readability and writability of code which
works with binary constants. As a side effect we will be able to make code
examples smaller and easier to read. For example:

```Rust
let udp_data = h"
    1111 2222
    0c00 ffff
    6461 7461
";
let packet = parse_udp(udp_data);
assert_eq!(packet.source_port, 0x1111);
assert_eq!(packet.dest_port, 0x2222);
assert_eq!(packet.data, b"data")
```

Comparison with existing syntax:
```Rust
let udp_data = b"\
    \x11\x11\x22\x22\
    \x0c\x00\xff\xff\
    \x64\x61\x74\x61\
";

let udp_data = [
    0x11, 0x11,  0x22, 0x22,
    0x0c, 0x00,  0xff, 0xff,
    0x64, 0x61,  0x74, 0x61,
];
```

Also it will allow to copy-paste hexidicimal data directly into Rust code without
an additional transformation step.

# Guide-level explanation
[guide-level-explanation]: #guide-level-explanation

Literals which start with `h` are called hex literals. They allow to
conviniently represent byte array constants in the hexadecimal form. String
inside `h"..."` accepts the following characters:

- Hexadecimal characters: `0-9, a-f, A-F`
- Formatting characters: unicode whitespace class characters, tab, carriage feed and return.

Formatting characters will be ignored by compiler. The following conditions
must be true for hex strings:

- Must contain even number of hexadecimal characters
- Must not contain only hexadecimal and formatting characters
- Formatting characters must not split octets, i.e. `h"a bc d"` is forbidden

Not complying with thise conditions will result in a compilation error.

Hexadecimal string will be converted to a byte array by compiler at compile time.

Usage examples:
```Rust
assert_eq!(h"00ff", &[0u8, 255u8]);
assert_eq!(h"abcdef", h"ABCDEF");
assert_eq!(h"64 61 74 61", b"data");

assert_eq!(h"
    00010203 0405060708
", &[0u8, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]);

assert_eq!(h"
    00010203
    10111213
", &[
    0x00, 0x01, 0x02, 0x03,
    0x10, 0x11, 0x12, 0x13
]);
```


# How We Teach This
[how-we-teach-this]: #how-we-teach-this
The book will need a page which will introduce and explain all variations of
string literals: `"..."`, `b"..."`, `r"..."`, `h"..."`. (and other future
extensions, e.g. like `s"..."` as a syntactic sugar for `"...".to_string()`)

# Drawbacks
[drawbacks]: #drawbacks

Additional syntax, which can be conceived by some as overly specialized for
niche use-cases.

# Rationale and Alternatives
[alternatives]: #alternatives

The proposed solution is arguably the simplest to use and read. Although
the following alternatives can be proposed:

- Instead of `h` use a base a modifier on the `b` prefix, e.g. `bx` for hex
binaries, `bo` for octal ones, `bb` for binary, or `bN` where N is the base
(between 2 and 36 included?)
- Built-in or procedural macro, e.g. `hex!("00 ff ee")`
- `const fn` (?)
- Do nothing and rely on existing tools.

The most notable one is procedural macro based solution. It will allow
to introduce similiar functionality without introducing the new syntax, but
it will be less usefull, especially in the case of residing in the external
crate. Thus considering small size and isolated nature of this feature,
in my opinion, the `h"..."` syntax will be the most optimal solution.
