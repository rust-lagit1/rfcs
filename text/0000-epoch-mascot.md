# Summary
[summary]: #summary

Have a mascot for each epoch.

# Motivation
[motivation]: #motivation

Branding is an important thing when selling your technology to others, including the non-technical
or project managers in charge of what gets used. As things change though we also want to be able to
convey that to users who might not have picked up or used Rust since the last epoch. In this way we
can have Ferris wear a new costume every epoch, or have an epoch-specific critter mascot much like
Ubundu does. It also conveys what we mean by [what an epoch is]: Each epoch plays nicely with the
previous ones despite having breaking changes. In the same way that Ferris has multiple costumes
they can all be worn, or mixed and matched, and are able to play with each other nicely. On top of
this they can act as a marker for embodying the accomplishments of the community after each epoch
begins.

# Detailed design
[design]: #detailed-design

Every epoch, the community team will look for mascot designs. These can be obtained
by paying a designer, or from submissions from the community. An idea thread may be put
up to get ideas for what the "theme" of the mascot will be.

# How We Teach This
[how-we-teach-this]: #how-we-teach-this

Unlike the more technical RFCs this is one where there would be tribal knowledge
on the matter and not one that would be documented in places like `TRPL`, or the
`Nomicon` for instance. Instead it would be taught through engagement with the
community, having events with the different mascots, as well as things
like conference T-Shirts.

# Drawbacks
[drawbacks]: #drawbacks

* Splits up the branding amongst multiple mascots rather than just one.

# Alternatives
[alternatives]: #alternatives

 - We do nothing at all and continue the course as is without any mascot at all.
 - We adopt different critters for each epoch, like Ubuntu

# Unresolved questions
[unresolved]: #unresolved-questions

Should we also be naming the epochs?
