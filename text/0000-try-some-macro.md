# Summary
[summary]: #summary

Add `try_some!` macro for `Option` equivalent to `try!` for `Result`.

# Motivation
[motivation]: #motivation

It would simplify some `Option` related functions.

# Detailed design
[design]: #detailed-design

Just simple macro that would be almost the same as `try!` macro:

```rust
macro_rules! try_some {
    ($expr:expr) => (match $expr {
        Some(val) => val,
        None => return None,
    });
}
```

Additionally I think that macro to early return from function that returns `()`
would be useful:

```rust
// â€¦
($expr:expr => return) => (match $expr {
    Some(val) => val,
    None => return,
})
```

Whole functionality is already implemented in [`soma` crate][soma], but I think
it would be useful to have that in `libcore`.

What should be macro name? Is `try_some!` ok? Would it be desired in community?
