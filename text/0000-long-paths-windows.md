# Summary
[summary]: #summary

Rust programs currently cannot access files on Windows 8 and below with paths longer than `MAX_PATH`.  This is a bug and should be fixed.

# Motivation
[motivation]: #motivation

Windows 8 and below make it difficult but not impossible for a program to access a file with a name longer than `MAX_PATH`.  The kernel APIs have no problem with such paths at all, but the user-mode APIs do.  They require that the path be prefixed with `\\?\`, which disables all normalization.

Fortunately, there is a solution that gets back normalization: if (and only if) the file name *does not* begin with `\??\` or `\\?\`, one can pass it to the Windows API function `GetFullPathNameW`, which supports long paths just fine and can easily be called from Rust.  The resulting path can safely have `\\?\` prepended and then be passed to the underlying Windows API calls.  `GetFullPathNameW`’s documentation claims that it does not support long paths, but it in fact does.

# Guide-level explanation
[guide-level-explanation]: #guide-level-explanation

This should require at most a brief mention in the Rust book.  All that is needed is a note that while many programs do not support long paths on Windows 8 and below (or Windows 10 without proper manifest/registry settings), Rust’s standard library has no such problems, and will work on any path that the underlying NT API supports.

# Reference-level explanation
[reference-level-explanation]: #reference-level-explanation

Whenever Rust sends a path to an underlying NT API, it should use first check if the path length is less than 260 characters **or** begins with either `\\?\` or `\??\`, then pass it to the underlying Windows API function directly.  Otherwise, pass it to `GetFullPathNameW`.  If it fails, return; if not, pass the result to the underlying Windows API call.

# Drawbacks
[drawbacks]: #drawbacks

This adds a small amount of complexity to the standard library.  This complexity should be more than compensated by the ability to handle long paths generated by e.g. NPM.

# Rationale and alternatives
[alternatives]: #alternatives

The alternatives are:

- Do nothing.  This is bad, because tools like NPM already support and generate long paths.
- Try to implement `GetFullPathNameW` in pure Rust.  This is not easy, and does not guarantee compatibility with the Windows implementation.
- Use `GetFullPathNameW` to allow for long paths on Windows.  This is the approach chosen here.

# Unresolved questions
[unresolved]: #unresolved-questions

None.  This is a bug fix, pure and simple.
