# Summary
[summary]: #summary

This RFC amends RFC #0809 to reduce the number of traits involved, take
allocators into account, and pin down the story on DST placement.

## Traits

There are now four traits:

1. `Placer` -- Placement in syntax:  `let owner = PLACE <- value`.
2. `Boxer` -- Box syntax: `let boxed: Box<_> = box value`.
3. `Place` -- An "out" pointer.
4. `Allocate` -- A trait that allows boxing and placing into `Allocator`s.

## Allocators

This RFC adds a new `Allocate` trait that can be implemented by any type that
takes an allocator. Implementing `Allocate` automatically implements `Boxer`
for boxing into allocators that implement `Default` and allows the type to be
allocated with a custom allocator using the `ALLOCATOR <- value` syntax.

## DSTs

`Boxer::make_place` and `Placer::make_place` are bounded by `Data: Sized` to
future proof against DST placement.

Furthermore, this RFC explicitly defines the guarantees of when/where
`Placer::make_place` will be called.

# Detailed design
[design]: #detailed-design

The new trait hierarchy is as follows:

```rust
/// Interface to implementations of  `PLACE <- EXPR`.
///
/// `PLACE <- EXPR` effectively desugars into:
///
/// ```rust,ignore
/// let p = PLACE;
/// let mut place = Placer::make_place(p);
/// let raw_place = Place::pointer(&mut place);
/// let value = EXPR;
/// unsafe {
///     std::ptr::write(raw_place, value);
///     Place::finalize(place)
/// }
/// ```
///
/// The type of `PLACE <- EXPR` is derived from the type of `PLACE` and the
/// context. If the type of `PLACE` is `P`, then the final type of the
/// expression is some owner such that `P` implements `Placer<typeof(EXPR), Owner>`.
///
/// Values for types implementing this trait usually are transient
/// intermediate values (e.g. the return value of `Vec::back`)
/// or `Copy`, since the `make_place` method takes `self` by value.
pub trait Placer<Data: ?Sized, Owner> {
    /// `Place` is the intermedate agent guarding the
    /// uninitialized state for `Data`.
    type Place: Place<Data=Data, Owner=Owner>;

    /// Creates a fresh place from `self`.
    fn make_place(self) -> Self::Place
        where Data: Sized;
}

/// Core trait for the `box EXPR` form.
///
/// `box EXPR` effectively desugars into:
///
/// ```rust,ignore
/// let mut place = Boxer::make_place();
/// let raw_place = Place::pointer(&mut place);
/// let value = EXPR;
/// unsafe {
///     ::std::ptr::write(raw_place, value);
///     Place::finalize(place)
/// }
/// ```
///
/// The type of `box EXPR` is supplied from its surrounding
/// context; in the above expansion, the result type `T` is used
/// to determine which implementation of `Boxer` to use, and that
/// `<T as Boxer>` in turn dictates which implementation of `Place` to use
/// (specifically, `<T as Boxer<typeof(EXPR)>>::Place`).
pub trait Boxer<Data: ?Sized>: Sized {
    /// The place that will negotiate the storage of the data.
    type Place: Place<Data=Data, Owner=Self>;

    /// Creates a globally fresh place.
    fn make_place() -> Self::Place
        where Data: Sized;
}

/// Both `PLACE <- EXPR` and `box EXPR` desugar into expressions
/// that allocate an intermediate "place" that holds uninitialized
/// state.  The desugaring evaluates EXPR, and writes the result at
/// the address returned by the `pointer` method of this trait.
///
/// A `Place` can be thought of as a special representation for a
/// hypothetical `&uninit` reference (which Rust cannot currently
/// express directly). That is, it represents a pointer to
/// uninitialized storage.
///
/// The client is responsible for two steps: First, initializing the
/// payload (it can access its address via `pointer`). Second,
/// converting the agent to an instance of the owning pointer, via the
/// appropriate `finalize` method.
///
/// If evaluating EXPR fails, then the destructor for the
/// implementation of Place is run to clean up any intermediate state
/// (e.g. deallocate box storage, pop a stack frame, etc).
pub unsafe trait Place {
    /// `Owner` is the type of the end value of both `PLACE <- EXPR` and
    /// `box EXPR`.
    ///
    /// Note that when `PLACE <- EXPR` is solely used for side-effecting an
    /// existing data-structure, e.g. `Vec::back`, then `Owner` need not carry
    /// any information at all (e.g. it can be the unit type `()` in that
    /// case).
    type Owner;

    /// `Data` is the type of the value to be emplaced.
    type Data: ?Sized;

    /// Returns the address where the input value will be written.
    /// Note that the data at this address is generally uninitialized,
    /// and thus one should use `ptr::write` for initializing it.
    fn pointer(&mut self) -> *mut Self::Data;

    /// Converts self into the final value, shifting deallocation/cleanup
    /// responsibilities (if any remain), over to the returned instance of
    /// `Owner` and forgetting self.
    unsafe fn finalize(self) -> Self::Owner;
}

/// All types implementing this trait can be constructed using using the `box`
/// keyword (iff the associated `Allocator` implements `Default`) or by placing
/// (`<-`) a value into an instance of the associated `Allocator`.
///
/// ```norun
/// let boxed1: Box<i32, SomeAllocator> = box 1; // where SomeAllocator: Default
/// let boxed2: Box<i32, SomeAllocator> = SomeAllocator::new() <- 1;
/// ```
pub trait Allocate<Data: ?Sized>: Sized {
    /// The place that will negotiate the storage of the data.
    type Place: Place<Data=Data, Owner=Self>;
    /// The allocator for this type.
    type Allocator: Allocator;

    /// Create a `Place` for `Self` with the given `Allocator`.
    fn allocate(with: Self::Allocator) -> Self::Place
        where Data: Sized;
}

```

Additionally, we define the following blanket impls to allow anything
implementing `Allocate` to be allocated in any `Allocator`. When specialization
lands, these can be marked default.

```rust
// Allows `let owner: T = ALLOCATOR <- thing;`
impl<T, D, A> Placer<D, A> for T
    where T: Allocator,
          A: Allocate<D, Allocator=T>
{
    type Place = A::Place;

    fn make_place(self) -> Self::Place
        where Self: Sized
    {
        A::allocate(self)
    }
}

// Allows `let owner: T = box thing;`
impl<A, D> Boxer<D> for A
    where A: Allocate<D>,
          A::Allocator: Default
{
    type Place = A::Place;

    fn make_place() -> Self::Place
        where Self: Sized
    {
        A::allocate(Default::default())
    }
}
```

Finally, to support DST placement, this RFC explicitly loosens the placement
protocol guarantees. Specifically, while `PLACE <- THING` is still guaranteed to
be evaluated left-to-right, the place is not guaranteed to be allocated before
of the expression on the right hand side has been fully evaluated. That is,
`Placer::make_place` may be called any time during the evaluation of `THING`.
DST placement needs this to be able to compute the size of the DST before
allocating the place.

For example, in the following cases, whether or not the `Box` is ever allocated
is explicitly undefined:

```rust
let _: Box<_> = box panic!();
let _: Box<_> = HEAP <- panic!();
```

However, in the following case, "here" will always be printed because the
expression is still guaranteed to be evaluated left-to-right:

```rust
let _: Box<_> = {
    println!("here");
    HEAP
} <- panic!();
```

For completeness, I've included the following DST placement traits to
demonstrate that the current placement traits are compatible with DST placement.
Note: A concrete design for returning DSTs is well outside the scope of this
RFC.

```rust
trait DstPlacer<Data: ?Sized, Placer>: Placer<Data, Output> {
    fn make_place_dynamic(self, layout: Layout) -> Self::Place;
}

trait DstBoxer<Data: ?Sized, A>: Placer<Data, A> where A: Allocator {
    fn make_place_dynamic(allocator: A, layout: Layout) -> Self::Place;
}

impl<T, D, B> DstPlacer<D, B> for T
    where T: Allocator,
          B: DstBoxer<D, T>
{
    type Place = B::Place;

    fn make_place_dynamic(self, layout: Layout) -> Self::Place {
        B::make_place_dynamic(self, layout)
    }
}

// Assuming specialization.
default impl<D, O> Placer<D, O> for T where T: DstPlacer<D, O> {
    fn make_place(self, layout: Layout) -> Self::Place
        where Self: Sized,
    {
        self.make_place_dynamic(Layout::new::<D>())
    }
}

default impl<D, A> Boxer<D, A> for T
    where T: DstBoxer<D, A>
          A: Allocator
{
    fn make_place(allocator: A) -> Self::Place
        where Self: Sized,
    {
        self.make_place_dynamic(Layout::new::<D>())
    }
}
```

## Choices

### Placer::make_place

`Placer::make_place` takes self by value. Taking self by reference as discussed
in #1286 would either require an option dance, HKT to properly handle lifetimes
(`type Place<'a> = ...`), or shenanigans. Furthermore, taking self by value
ensures that non-copy placers are used only once. This allows panic-free
allocation using `try!(place) <- thing`.

### Parameterize Placer with Owner

`Owner` is now a type parameter in `Placer`. This allows placement in syntax to
be used with allocators. That is:

```rust
let boxed_thing: Box<_> = HEAP <- thing1;
let rced_thing: Rc<_> = HEAP <- thing2;
```

If `PLACER <- thing` can have precisely one type as in the original RFC, it
wouldn't be possible to produce both `Rc`s and `Box`s (see alternatives for an
alternative solution).

# Drawbacks
[drawbacks]: #drawbacks

## Placer::make_place self by value

Taking self by-value means that `vec <- value` won't work. However, `vec.back()
<- value` still works just fine so I'm not convinced this is a problem.

The other drawback is that `arena <- value` won't work either. One solution is
to autoref the placer if necessary but,

1. I'm not entirely convinced this use case is common enough to be worth it.
2. This is a backwards compatible change that can be made at any time.

## Place taking Owner as a type parameter

This could interfere with type inference but shouldn't be an issue. In most
cases, `Placer` will only be defined for one `Owner` per type.

# Alternatives
[alternatives]: #alternatives

## Get rid of Placer

Instead of having a `Placer`, we could allow placing directly into `Place`s.
Unfortunately, to allow expressions that may or may not be placed into (e.g.
`map.entry(k) <- v`), the `Place` would have to allocate in `Place::pointer`
instead of on construction to avoid allocating unnecessarily. This, in turn,
means that the `Place` would have to manually keep track of whether or not it
has allocated. Using a `Placer` allows us to store this in the type system
itself which:

1. Is less error prone.
2. Is probably more optimizable.


## Placer with an associated Owner

Instead of making the `Placer` trait take `Owner` as a type argument, we could
add the following default method to the `Allocator` trait:

```rust
trait Allocator {
    /* ... */
    fn emplace<B: Boxer>(self) -> BoxPlacer<Self, B> {
        BoxPlacer {
            allocator: self,
            _marker: PhantomData,
        }
    }
}

pub struct BoxPlacer<A: Allocator, B> {
    allocator: A,
    _marker: PhantomData(fn() -> B)
}

impl<A, B, D> Placer<D> for BoxPlacer<A, B>
    where B: Boxer<D>,
          A: Allocator,
{
    fn make_place(self) -> B::Place
        where Self: Sized,
    {
        <B as Boxer<D>>::make_place(self)
    }
}
```

We could then use `let boxed = HEAP.emplace::<Type<_>>() <- value;` to select
the output type. However, IMO, this is much less ergonomic.

## The Allocate trait

Instead of having an `Allocate` trait, we could have all `Boxer`s take
`Allocator`s. However, as @nagisa has pointed out, not all `Boxer`s will need
an `Allocator` (some may, e.g., use object pools).
